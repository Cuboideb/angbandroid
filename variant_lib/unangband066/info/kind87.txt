=== Advice for Adventurers with a bone to Pick ===

Keep finding yourself attacking monsters with this useful digger instead of
your nice new shiny sword?

Inscribe it with ^; and you'll be saved the embarrassment of wandering around
the dungeon with the wrong weapon.

It works because the ^ symbol prevents you doing the following command while
the item is equipped, and ; is used as the 'internal' command for movement.

Magic!

PS: Aside from the fact I have no idea what I just said, don't you find it
strange that you can't see what weapon you're using while you walk around?
I'm finding the opposite problem since I've gone through this bag: I've got
my equipped weapon held up awkwardly in my field of view, while I feel like
living a Half Life because I can't see my own feet.

PPS: If my post script doesn't make any sense, it's because I'm doing the
punchline for a gag I haven't set up yet. Come back and re-read this when
you've found enough magic bags...
