             *** Floating eyes (e) ***

Strange disembodied eyes, floating around the dungeon. Some 
of them are comparatively harmless (such as the [[[[[oFloating eyes],
[[[[[RRadiation eyes], [[[[[rBloodshot eyes], and [[[[[vDisenchanter eyes]),
others moderately dangerous (such as the [[[[[DEvil eyes], [[[[[sGauths],
[[[[[gGas spores], and [[[[[BSpectators]), yet others extremely deadly - 
these include the [[[[[UBeholders], [[[[[uUndead beholders], [[[[[bEyes of the]
[[[[[bdeep], and the [[[[[yBeholder hive-mothers]. Whatever you do, do 
not get too close to them


                *** Jellies (j) ***

You will sometimes encounter large quavering piles of flesh
just lying around the dungeon or making their way along the 
walls. They all have different defense mechanisms, which with 
time an adventurer will learn to recognise by looking at their 
colour. Among the less dangerous types are [[[[[wWhite jellies], [[[[[rRed]
[[[[[rjellies], [[[[[bBlue jellies], [[[[[vGrape jellies], [[[[[gGreen jellies], [[[[[WSilver]
[[[[[Wjellies], [[[[[yYellow jellies], [[[[[oSpotted jellies], and [[[[[uRot jellies]. 
Considerably more dangerous are the [[[[[DUndead masses] and [[[[[UOchre]
[[[[[Ujellies], as well as [[[[[DBlack puddings]. Among the moving jellies, 
watch out for [[[[[gGreen oozes], [[[[[bBlue oozes], [[[[[DBlack oozes], [[[[[GGelatinous]
[[[[[Gcubes], [[[[[RGibbering mouthers], and [[[[[BAcidic cytoplasms].

                 *** Molds (m) ***

Molds are strange growths on the dungeon floor which have
developed defense mechanisms to deal with anyone who tries
to disturb them. They come in many varieties and prefer
different habitats, and some of them can be quite dangerous
because they have rudimentary mastery of the elements. The
most common varieties of mold are the [[[[[sGrey mold], the [[[[[rRed]
[[[[[rmold], the [[[[[oHairy mold], the [[[[[gGreen mold], the [[[[[uBrown mold], 
the [[[[[yYellow mold], the [[[[[wWhite mold], and the [[[[[WSilver mold]. 
More rare are [[[[[vDisenchanter molds], [[[[[bShimmering molds], [[[[[RPink]
[[[[[Rmolds], [[[[[GTree molds], and [[[[[BBlue molds]. A very rare and dire
creature is the [[[[[DDeath mold] - unwary adventurers beware! The
[[[[[UAdventurer molds] are friendly towards their fellows, but 
not very strong.

            *** Mushroom patches (,) ***

You'd think it safe to eat them - you'd be wrong. Mushroom
patches are masters of disguise and can cause quite a bit 
of damage to unwary adventurers. Fortunately, most of them 
are extremely weak and can be destroyed quickly if you can
just get close enough. The commonly found varieties include
the [[[[[sgrey], [[[[[Bclear], [[[[[vpurple], [[[[[ospotted], [[[[[yyellow], [[[[[Rshrieker], [[[[[Ddark], 
[[[[[wwhite], [[[[[ubrown], [[[[[Wsilver], and [[[[[Ggreen] mushroom patches. More rare 
are [[[[[gshambling mounds], [[[[[Bmagic mushroom patches], [[[[[rblood sprouts], 
and [[[[[bmemory mosses].

               *** Quylthulgs (Q) ***

Strange pulsing mounds of flesh that looks utterly harmless.
As with any other monster, however, looks are very deceiving
when it comes to the [[[[[yQuylthulgs]. They are expert at asking
for other creatures' help, as weall as conveyance magic. The
only friendly type is the [[[[[wAdventurer quylthulg] - these have
many friends among their own kin. The [[[[[vNexus quylthulg] is 
unmatched in conveyance magic; you will have trouble getting
close to it. The other quylthulgs usually prefer to call for
aid, and you can tell what kind of creatures are likely to 
come to its call, usually. There are [[[[[DSpider], [[[[[sCanine], [[[[[bAquatic],
[[[[[uRotting], [[[[[gDraconic], [[[[[rDemonic], [[[[[UGreater rotting], [[[[[Ggreater] 
[[[[[GDraconic], [[[[[RGreater demonic], and [[[[[BMaster quylthulgs].
