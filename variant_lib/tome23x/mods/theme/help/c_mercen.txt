#####R=== Mercenaries ===

#####GDescription
Mercenaries are daring swashbucklers, masters of the blade. They
do not have the magical abilities Rogues have, but they are just
as stealthy and much deadlier with a light sword. They do gain
some magical mastery over time, but only in the Temporal school.
