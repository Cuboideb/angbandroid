=== Using the Online Help ===

You can press Escape (ESC) at any time to leave the online help.

You can press Question Mark (?) to return to the previous help file.

You can press Space to advance one page, Plus (+) to advance one half page,
or Return to advance one line.  If you reach the end, you will jump to the
start.  You can press Minus (-) to back up one half page, Underscore (_) to
back up one page, or Equal (=) to back up one line.  If you reach the start,
you will stay there.  Advancing by one page is the only efficient method.

You can press Pound (#) [or Percent (%)] to go to a specific line [or file].

You can press Slash (/) [or Ampersand (&)] to search for [or hilite] a string
(case-insensitive by default, (!) toggles to case-sensitive).
Use "#" + "0" + Return + "/" + Return to restart a search.

Please continue to press Space to view the rest of this file...
