            -- Welcome to Unangband --

You will be asked a number of questions to help you customise
your in-game experience. Please answer them to the best of
your ability.

The keyboard layout you choose will determine which keys you
use to control your in-game character. If you choose the
desktop layout, you will use what is called the 'original'
command keys. You will use the number pad to navigate around
in the directions you choose.

If you choose the laptop layout, you will use what is called
the 'roguelike' command keys. You will use the letters h, j,
k, l, y, u, b and n to navigate around in the directions you
choose as follows:

   y k u
    \|/
   h-@-l
    /|\
   b j n

You can get a full list of commands you can use at at any
time by pressing Enter on your keyboard. Pressing ? can also
be used to access the in-game help system, which provides
further information about playing the game.
