#####R === FuryMod Powers - Maiaology ===

Available only to maiaologists, or those sufficiently corrupted with
darkmaia-like powers, this school contains spells where maiaic energies
are used to create mainly devastating effects.

#####oDarkMaia equipment
Unlike other magic schools, the spells of a Maiaologist are not written
in spell books, but are contained within items of maiaic origin known as
Maiablades, Maiashields, and Maiahorns (helms), which when wielded allow
the Maiaologist to cast spells; each piece of equipment holds three spells.

#####oMaiablade spells
1. [[[[[oMaia Blade] (school level 1)
   Imbues your blade with fire to deal more damage.
   At level 30 it deals hell fire damage.
   At level 45 it spreads over a 1 radius zone around your target.
2. [[[[[oMaia Madness] (school level 10)

3. [[[[[oUnholy Word] (school level 25)
