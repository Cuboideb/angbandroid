=== A Desperate Hunger - Part II ===

Once you become accustomed to the art of eating 'dungeon chicken', you'll
discover there are several methods to preparing it to make it more
palatable.  The simplest is cooking it, which requires a source of fire.
Alternately, you can salt the meat using a potion of Salt Water.  Both
techniques result in slabs of meat which have the same nutritional value
as rations, although being slightly bulkier and prone to filling you up.

For my favourite, try tossing a few Giant Field Mice on a brazier, and
serving it up with a mug of warmed Slime Mould Juice. Mmm...
