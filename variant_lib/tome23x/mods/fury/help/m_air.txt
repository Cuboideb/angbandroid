#####R === FuryMod Powers - Air School ===

The air school of magic contains spells where the element of air is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the Blowing
Wind" which contains all the air school spells within it's bindings.

the air school at a level of 2/3 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill

spells.
