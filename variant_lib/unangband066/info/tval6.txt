=== Bodies & Body Parts ===

Monster remains litter the dungeon and can be used to hint at what
creatures inhabit the level you are currently on. Approximately two thirds
of body parts you find will be from creatures that live on the current
level. If you find rooms littered with bodies, blood and body parts, it
is a strong clue that some evil is at work here.

Occasionally you will find a body part from a creature deeper in the
dungeon - you can 'I'nspect or e'x'amine this to find out some information
about the creature in question, even if you have not previously encountered
it. If the most powerful monster on a level is significantly more dangerous
than other monsters on the level, you will find a lot more remains than you
would otherwise expect to do so, and far less other creatures.

It is also rumoured that powerful magics and magic-users can animate the
bones of departed creatures from the dead into powerful zombified or
mummified opponents.  Even various body-parts could be so animated - that
could explain the stories you've heard of magical hands running around
the dungeon using their fingertips as feet.
