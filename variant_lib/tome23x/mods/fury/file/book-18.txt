              *** Minor Demons (u) ***

These demons (roeg) are corrupted forms of natural creatures.
The individual types of demons are as follows: [[[[[bLimrog] (fish),
[[[[[UCaborrog] (frog), [[[[[DLygrog] (snake), [[[[[oDraugrog] (wolf), [[[[[rHurog] (dog),
[[[[[sSarnrog] (stone), [[[[[gNarrog] (rat), [[[[[yAewrog] (bird), [[[[[BRawrog] (lion),
and [[[[[RAdanrog] (human).

              *** Major Demons (u) ***

The major demons are of two kinds - the spider demons, spawn of
Ungoliant, and the Balroeg, corrupted Maiar. The spider demons
are as follows: [[[[[gUngorrog] (power spider demon), [[[[[WHelcungol] (ice),
[[[[[rNaurungol] (fire), [[[[[sMornungol] (black), and [[[[[BFaunungol] (cloud).
There are also the [[[[[BGaurroeg] (water demons), [[[[[oMorgulroeg] (magic
demons), [[[[[uDagorrog] (war demons), [[[[[ySererrog] (blood demons), and 
the [[[[[UMenelroeg] (sky demons). The Balroeg can be [[[[[RRed], [[[[[DBlack],
[[[[[wWhite], and [[[[[bBlue] - commanded by [[[[[GBalrog Captains] and [[[[[vGreater]
[[[[[vBalroeg].

             *** Greater Undead (G) ***

The ghosts are incorporeal beings with awesome magical powers.
Some of them aren't very impressive, like the [[[[[gGreen glutton] 
[[[[[gghost] and the [[[[[sPoltergeist]. Others are deadlier - [[[[[wGhosts],
[[[[[BPhantom beasts], [[[[[BDrowned souls], [[[[[BPhantom warriors], the [[[[[DShadows], 
[[[[[DPossessors], [[[[[DShades], and [[[[[USpectres]. The friendly [[[[[WSpirits] will
try to help adventurers. The [[[[[bBanshee], [[[[[GSpirit troll], [[[[[vPhantom],
[[[[[uHeadless ghost], and [[[[[uMoaning spirit] are all to be reckoned with.
In a class of their own are the [[[[[oDreads], [[[[[rDreadlords], and the 
[[[[[yDreadmasters].

                 *** Liches (L) ***

Yet another kind of powerful undead. Many things can take the form
of a lich, but the [[[[[oLich], [[[[[GCrypt thing], [[[[[WIron lich], [[[[[rMaster lich],
[[[[[uMonastic lich], [[[[[UDemilich], [[[[[BArchlich], [[[[[DBlack reaver], and [[[[[sLesser] 
[[[[[sblack reaver] all deserve special mention.


                *** Wraiths (W) ***

Wraiths are incorporeal beings frequently found in graveyards and
at the sites of unavenged murders. There are [[[[[wWhite wraiths], [[[[[sGrey]
[[[[[swraiths], [[[[[WSilver wraiths], [[[[[GNether wraiths], and [[[[[DBlack wraiths].
The [[[[[UAdventurer wraiths] will try to help you. Fierce and magical 
are the many wights: [[[[[BBarrow wights], [[[[[gForest wights], [[[[[bGrave wights], 
[[[[[oSwamp wights], and [[[[[rEmperor wights]. The most dangerous among the 
wraith beings are the [[[[[uRevenant], [[[[[DNightwalker], [[[[[DNightcrawler], and 
[[[[[DNightwing].
