#####R=== Lygroeg (Snake Demons) ===

#####GDescription
These slithering snakelike demons lack many physical 
advantages of their humanoid cousins, but they have 
access to lost and forgotten realms of magic that 
enable them to overcome their physical handicaps, if
they can survive long enough to reap the benefits of
their experience, that is. As highly magical creatures,
they are no good at anything else.
