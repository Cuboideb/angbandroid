=== The Town Level ===

The town level is where you will begin your adventure.  The town consists of
a number of buildings (each with an entrance), some townspeople, and a wall
which surrounds the town.  The first time you are in town it will be daytime,
but note that the sun rises and falls as time passes.

=== Townspeople ===

The town contains many different kinds of people.  There are the street
urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to
come out of the woodwork when excited.  Blubbering idiots are a constant
annoyance, but not harmful.  Public drunks wander about the town singing,
and are of no threat to anyone.  Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a
likely victim to mug.  And finally, no town would be complete without a
swarm of half drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just for
the fun of it.

Most of the townspeople should be avoided by the largest possible distance
when you wander from store to store.  Fights will break out, though, so be
prepared.  Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no
experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.

You'll probably want to go shopping for supplies before you travel any
where.  Shops entrances are indicated by various numbers on your display.
To enter a shop, you just need to walk onto the entrance.  To reenter a
shop, you can use the enter command ('_').
