#####R === FuryMod Powers - Water School ===

The water school of magic contains spells where the element of water is
used to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the
Everrunning Wave" which contains all the water school spells within it's
bindings.

Worshipping the Goddess Yavanna Kementari also gives the ability to cast spells
from the water school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5 water school
spells.
