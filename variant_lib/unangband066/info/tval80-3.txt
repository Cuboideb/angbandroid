=== An Authoratative Guide to Mushrooms ===

Mushrooms come in a variety of colours and flavours, which can
change with every season.  Your only reliable guide to mushrooms
is Farmer Maggot's Mushroom Emporium, where you can find the 
latest and most fashionable mushroom flavours at affordable
prices.  Do not eat mushrooms you find in the wild.

A forthcoming illustrated guide in colour will also be available
from my publishing agents in due course.
