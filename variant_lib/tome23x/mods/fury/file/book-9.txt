                  *** Townsfolk (t) ***

These are the monsters you will find in the various towns all across 
Middle-earth. Most of them are neutral to the player, though those who 
are not neutral are quite harmless, unless you take them on before you 
are strong enough. The townsfolk include [[[[[oAimless-looking merchants], 
[[[[[UPitiful-looking beggars], [[[[[ySinging, happy drunks], [[[[[uMangy-looking lepers], 
[[[[[GVillage idiots], [[[[[WBlubbering idiots], [[[[[RBoil-covered wretches], [[[[[gWoodsmen], 
[[[[[wSanctimonious-looking preachers], [[[[[vWeary-looking travellers], 
[[[[[DFilthy street urchins], [[[[[rMean-looking mercenaries], 
[[[[[bAgents of the black market], and [[[[[BBattle-scarred veterans].

                    *** Humans (p) ***

These are the various humans inhabiting Middle-earth, from all trades 
and professions, of varying degrees of experience. The novices and 
apprentices are just what their titles imply: new to the craft and thus
easier to deal with than more advanced masters. Depending on the 
player's race, some of these may be neutral or even coaligned. The 
trades include [[[[[brogues], [[[[[uwarriors], [[[[[rmages], [[[[[omystics], [[[[[Rsorcerers], [[[[[Wrangers],
[[[[[Gdruids], [[[[[wpaladins], [[[[[ymindcrafters], and [[[[[gpriests].

These also include various subraces of humans from different parts of
Middle-earth, including the moderately dangerous [[[[[Ueasterlings], [[[[[rVariags], 
[[[[[UCorsairs of Umbar], [[[[[uHaradrim], [[[[[sWainriders], and [[[[[gDunlendings], the very
dangerous [[[[[DBlack Numenoreans] and [[[[[DOathbreakers], as well as the friendly
(yet deadly when roused) [[[[[BWavelords].


               *** Elves and Halflings (h) ***

The Halflings are a shy race, so there are not that many of them - only
the [[[[[sScruffy-looking hobbits] and [[[[[UHalfling slingers]. Very stealthy and 
good shots, Halflings. They make excellent burglars.

The [[[[[BMermaids] are an enigma, some argue that they are simply drowned 
Elven maidens, others say they're half-human, half-fish. Whatever they
are, they are quite dangerous to the unwary adventurer. Another odd
race are the [[[[[yMind flayers], whose mind powers are legendary and ability
to deprive others of their sanity unmatched.

The majority of Elven monsters an adventurer will encounter in the 
dungeons will be Dark Elves, all good at a particular profession, and
much better at these professions than their human counterparts. There 
are simple [[[[[DDark elves] who live by their wits and a bit of magic, and 
then there are [[[[[vDark elven warlocks], [[[[[RDark elven sorcerers], [[[[[GDark elven] 
[[[[[Gdruids], [[[[[gDark elven priests], [[[[[uDark elven warriors], and [[[[[rDark elven] 
[[[[[rmages], all commanded by [[[[[DDark elven lords].

Not all Elves you meet will be hostile and expert at the Dark arts, 
however, among them the [[[[[bAquatic elven warriors], [[[[[WElven archers],
[[[[[wHigh-elven rangers], and [[[[[oAquatic elven mages].

                   *** Dwarves (k) ***

A hardy and stout race, the Dwarves make formidable opponents to any 
adventurer who encounters them. They, too, practice a variety of trades,
though their spectrum is not as wide-ranging as that of humans or elves.
The [[[[[DDark dwarven lords] rule over the [[[[[gDark dwarven priests], [[[[[uDark dwarven] 
[[[[[uwarriors], and [[[[[wDark dwarven smiths].

The Dwarves do not trust magic, but a subrace of them - the Petty-dwarves
- do practice it, you will see both plain [[[[[sPetty-dwarves] and [[[[[RPetty-dwarf] 
[[[[[Rmages].

Some adventurers who know the correct incantation will be able to summon 
[[[[[Udwarven warriors] to their aid.

           *** Gnomes, leprawns, and their kin (l) ***

The gnomes are a less-well-known race on Middle-earth; they are related 
to the Petty-dwarves, but they are not nearly as stout as Dwarves. The 
gnomes are quite cunning and smart, but not very strong. Their [[[[[sgnome lords]
command the [[[[[ugnome warriors], [[[[[bgnome rogues], [[[[[rgnome priests], [[[[[Rgnome mages], 
[[[[[wgnome paladins], and [[[[[ognome mystics].

A race closely related to gnomes are the leprawns - they are even smaller 
than gnomes, and much weaker. However, leprawns breed very quickly and an 
unwary adventurer might be overrun if he is not careful! The [[[[[vmalicious] 
[[[[[vleprawns] are a nuisance, the [[[[[Wwizard leprawns] are a dangerous nuisance,
and one is not advised to underestimate the [[[[[Ddeath leprawns].

There also exist [[[[[Gcheerful leprawns] and [[[[[Uadventurer gnomes], who have broken
with the traditions of their races, and might agree to help other adventurers.

A strange race from the depths are the [[[[[glizard men] with their [[[[[rlizard kings] - 
they are quite strong and command powerful magic. These creatures prefer to 
live in swamps and shallow water areas, however, so you will not encounter 
them in the dungeons often.
