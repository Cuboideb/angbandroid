#####R=== Aule's Priests ===

#####GDescription
*****g_aule.txt*0[Aule] the Smith is concerned with the substance of 
Arda; rock and metal. His priests serve him best by forging better
weapons to use in the fight against the Dark, and his most beloved 
weapon is the axe, which his followers will find much easier to use 
than other types of weapons. Aule's realms are earth and fire, and
his priests have access to these realms by the grace of their Vala.
