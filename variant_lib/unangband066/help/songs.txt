=== Song Specialists ===

    There are two types of song book specialists: those who specialise in
    instruments, and those who specialise in improvisation from a single
    song book.  Each song book has an accompanying instrument which
    benefits the bard if they are wielding the instrument at the same time
    as they cast from the song book, but instrument specialists gain much
    greater benefit in doing so.
    
    Improvisation specialists gain their benefits only for a limited number
    of songs - those which are cast from the song book they have chosen.
    These books can only be located in the dungeon, or certain stores which
    can only be found late in the game.

***** <Shanties>

        Discordance
        
          Discordant songs are the thunder of a volcano and the shudder of

          the singer.

        Beats
        
          Beats are the slaps on the thighs and the stamping of feet in
