#####R=== Dragons ===

#####GDescription
Dragons are majestic creatures of power traditionally aligned with
the forces of evil. However, some may choose to become adventurers.
They may not wield any weapons, bows, or play musical instruments.
However, they are able to fly from birth, and gain resistances to
some of the elements (depending on their subrace). Dragons have to 
choose a subrace specific to their race. Dragons make very good
Mages, but they cannot become Geomancers, because they are unable
to wield mage staves. As winged beings, Dragons may not wear cloaks.
