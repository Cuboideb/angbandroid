Slinger automatically gain the *****ability.txt*07[Ammo Creation] ability when they reach character 
level 2. (Other classes can purchase this ability when they have enough skill 
points.) This ability is accessed via the 'm' command. You need dungeon junk to 
make ammo. Each type of ammo requires certain kinds of junk. The first type of 
ammo you can make is pebbles; as you increase in skill you'll be able to make 
other types.
