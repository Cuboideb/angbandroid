=== Creating a Character ===

Zangband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of Zangband. Perhaps the most important thing
you control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or
allow to be chosen various attributes that will affect the future life
of your character.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of
choices as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play,
followed by a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a
random character matching the appropriate constraints.

Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you
have generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth
between the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a
character that you feel comfortable with.

You may start the entire process over at any time by pressing 'ESC' at
any prompt (with the exception of the autoroller (see below [1]) prompt
and the prompt for the number of random quests (see below [2])).  Also,
on the final screen, use delete or backspace to restart.

***** <BirthOptions>
=== Birth Options ===

During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access
the options screen. A more detailed description of the various options
can be found in the section on the Options Page (see option.txt [3]).
Here you may set yout 'Birth options' which are options set at birth
and which cannot be changed again during the game. Note that you may
change your birth option preferences in game but these will only have
effect in your next character. Perhaps one of the most important
features of the birth options is the ability to decide what type of
town level you want. The various town options are discussed on the Town
page (see town.txt#TownLevel [4]). Another important decision to make
is whether you wish to use the Autoroller (see below [1]) or the point-
based character generation system (see below [d]).


***** <CharAttributes>
=== Character Attributes ===

Once you begin character generation you will be asked to choose
your character's three primary attributes - its sex, race and
class. If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will also be
prompted for your choice of magic realm(s).

Your character's sex has a minimal effect on game play - females start
with slightly more gold, males are generally heavier and so can bash
more effectively. Race, class and magic realms have a far more
significant effect and are discussed at some length in the Race (see
charattr.txt#TheRaces [5]), Class (see charattr.txt#TheClasses [6])
and Magic Realms (see magic.txt#MagicRealms [7]) sections.

--- Secondary Attributes ---

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height, weight, social
class, and background history, which are randomly determined, but which
are affected by the sex and race of the character. In general, these
attributes are only used to provide "flavor" to the character, to
assist in the roll playing, but they do have a few minor effects on the
game. For example, background history affects social class, which
affects the amount of money the character will start with. And weight
affects carrying capacity and bashing ability.

***** <RaceClassComb> 
=== Race/Class Combinations ===

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. Some 
race/class combinations are not recommended and so certain classes are
shown inside brackets. This may be because the combination is not
conceptually sound or because the chosen race has stat penalties in
areas where that class needs bonuses.

However, any race/class combination can be chosen and experienced
players may often choose unusual combinations for the challenge that
they represent. It is recommended that inexperienced players choose
warriors as spellcasting requires a player more familiar with dungeon
survival techniques.

The following table shows which classes are recommended for the various
races.

***** <ChoosingMagic>
=== Choosing Your Magic Realm(s) ===

If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will next be prompted
for your choice of magic realm(s). The magic system, as implemented in
Zangband, consists of seven realms: Life, Arcane, Sorcery, Nature,
Trump, Chaos and Death. In general, Life is primarily defensive but
also offers spells to attack evil creatures, Arcane offers utility
spells and some limited offensive capability, Sorcery offers utility
and defensive spells, Nature offers both defensive and offensive
spells, Trump specializes in teleportation and summoning spells and
Chaos and Death are offensive. A more complete description of the magic
realms and spellcasting in general can be found in the section on the
Magic Realms (see magic.txt#MagicRealms [7]).

Where possible, it is generally a good idea to pick one defensive realm
and one offensive realm. If you pick the realms always in the same
order (e.g. nature as your first realm and chaos as your second realm,
not the other way around) you will be less confused when trying to
pick the correct spellbook to use in the game.

***** <Restrictions>
--- Class/Realm Restrictions ---

In Zangband, spellcasting classes can select either one or two realms
from those available. Some classes which can learn two realms may learn
their first realm 'better' than their second.

Note that certain realms may be prohibited for some classes. In the
table below, '1st' indicates that the realm may only be the first
choice, '2nd' indicates that the realm may only be the second choice
and '1st/2nd' indicates that it can be either. Classes that only have
'1st' options do not get a second realm. Classes with only one '1st'
option must choose this option as their first realm.

Class          Life    Arcane  Sorcery Nature  Trump   Chaos   Death
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mage           1st/2nd 1st/2nd 1st/2nd 1st/2nd 1st/2nd 1st/2nd 1st/2nd
Priest         1st     2nd     2nd     2nd     2nd     2nd     1st
Rogue                  1st     1st             1st             1st
Ranger                 2nd     2nd     1st     2nd     2nd     2nd
Paladin        1st                                             1st
Warrior-Mage   2nd     1st     2nd     2nd     2nd     2nd     2nd

Monk           1st                     1st                     1st
High Mage      1st     1st     1st     1st     1st     1st     1st


***** <RandomQuests>
=== RandomQuests ===

Once you have chosen your race, class and (if applicable) your magic
realm(s), you will be asked how many random quests you wish to be
assigned. You may choose any number between 0 and 49. A more detailed
discussion of random quests can be found in the Dungeon section (see
dungeon.txt#RandomQuests [8]).


***** <AutoRoller>
=== The Auto-Roller ===

The auto-roller is a quick means of generating start-up characters
based on a set of user-selected criteria. If you choose to use the
auto-roller, you will be prompted to enter a weighting from 1-100 for
each stat. These weightings should give how important you think it is 
for each stat to be close to the maximum possible for your character.

Once you have entered your desired statistics, the computer will then
randomly roll successive start-up characters and rate them based on
the weightings you provided. Each stat is rolled as a number from 8 
to 17, with a normal distribution, and is then immediately modified 
based upon the race and class which you have chosen. The exact 
quantum of this modification can be found in the Character Attributes 
section (see charattr.txt#StatBonusTable [a]).

***** <CharDisplay>
After a fixed number of character rolls, the computer will select the
character with the highest rating and display it for you to look at. If
you accept the rolled character (by pressing 'Esc'), you will be asked
for its name (see below [c]). If not, you may press 'r' to resume
rolling and generate another set of character or, if this is not your
first set, 'p' to return to the previous character which was selected.

If you select not to use the auto-roller, the computer will roll one
random character at a time and then display it for you to either accept
or reject. The 'r', 'p' and 'Esc' keys will work as outlined above.


***** <PointBased>
=== Point-based Character Generation ===
This alternative method of determining your starting statistics gives
you 48 'points' which may be 'spent' on increasing your statistics
according to your own preference.  Using this system you are better
able to customize your character but may not get such high individual
statistics as are possible with th auto-roller. Note that as your stats
get higher it takes more points to increase them further. Also note
that should you choose not to spend all your points, you will be given
100 gold pieces for each unused point subject to an upper limit of 600
gold pieces.


***** <CharName>
=== Naming Your Character ===

Once you have accepted a character you will be asked to provide a name
for the character. In general, the actual choice of a name is not
important, but do keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game
itself. For example, on some machines, the character name determines
the filename that will be used to save the character to disk. On
others, the character name specifies special "pref" files. And the
character name is used on the high score list.


***** <StartInventory>
=== Starting Inventory ===

Once you have named your character, you will be prompted to press 'Esc'
and, having done so, you will be brought to the town screen from where
you will begin your adventuring. You should note that each character
starts in the town with a small number of items in their inventory.
Which items you are given will depend upon your chosen race and class
and the number of such items depends on chance. For example, all
classes receive either food rations or scrolls of satisfy hunger but
the number of rations or scrolls received is random. Typically, you
will receive a weapon, a piece of armor, some food, some torches and
a magical item although there is some variance from this.
