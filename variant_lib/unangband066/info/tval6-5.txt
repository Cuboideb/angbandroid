=== A Desperate Hunger ===

If you are starving and alone, the lure of uncooked flesh can prove too
much, and you will find yourself able to stomach things you would otherwise
find unpalatable.  If you are an orc, troll or giant, you will find
this custom much easier to break.  And if you have the touch of undeath
around you...

Most things are safe to eat, but beware the flesh of creatures that
have spores, or are unsafe to touch.
