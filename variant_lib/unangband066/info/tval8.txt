=== Skins, Scales and Fur ===

Monster remains litter the dungeon and can be used to hint at what
creatures inhabit the level you are currently on. Approximately two thirds
of body parts you find will be from creatures that live on the current
level. If you find rooms littered with animal fur, bird feathers or
reptilian scales, this strongly suggests that these have been shed by
some powerful creature nearby.

Occasionally you score a blow on an enemy that knocks lose some fur,
feathers or scales.  This is an indication of a powerful hit, and a few
more of those should be quick to send an enemy fleeing or to its grave.

It is also rumoured that powerful magics and magic-users can summon beasts
that are either furred, feathered or foul.  If so, the favoured creatures
of men, elves and other fair creatures would be birds, and foul monsters
would be scaled and soft-skinned things that we were not meant to know.
