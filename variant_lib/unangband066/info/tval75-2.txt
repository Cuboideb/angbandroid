=== An Addendum to the Overview of Potions ===

Potions come in a variety of colours and flavours, which can
change with every game. You'll usually need to relearn which
flavour or colour corresponds to which type of potion every
game you play.  You can learn this information in several
ways: by starting the game with that type of potion, by buying
or selling the potion to or from the shop or by quaffing the
potion and noticing its effects.

You could also experiment with throwing potions using the throw
command ('t' or 'v' in the roguelike commands) or by applying
them to weapons using the apply command ('y' or '^G' in the
roguelike command set).  These uses of potions are probably best
reserved for any harmful potions that you may find.

Finally, you may be able to learn spells or find items with
the ability to provide more information about unknown potions.
Identify or Analyze Magic spells will let you learn the type
of potion outright.  Sense Magic will let you learn which of
several types of category the potion falls into.  Keep an eye
out for items with these abilities to help you identify the
potions you encounter without having to use them up.
