               *** Vortices (v) ***

These strange creatures are like localised tornadoes,
carrying with them the various elements: [[[[[rfire], [[[[[benergy],
[[[[[ggas], [[[[[wcold], [[[[[sacid], [[[[[ushards], [[[[[vnexus], [[[[[ymana], [[[[[Uconfusion],
[[[[[Wslowness], [[[[[vchaos], [[[[[Gnether], [[[[[Rplasma], and [[[[[Btime]. Among 
these, the nastiest by far are the [[[[[vstorms of unmagic],
as well as [[[[[oshimmering], [[[[[Ddeath], and [[[[[vaether] vortices.

                *** Spirits (E) ***

These are the spirits contained in various elements, they
are weaker than the proper elementals. There are [[[[[rFire] 
[[[[[rspirits], [[[[[bWater spirits], [[[[[uEarth spirits], and [[[[[BAir spirits]
alongside [[[[[WWill'o the wisps] and [[[[[yInvisible stalkers].

               *** Elementals (E) ***

Towering masses of raw elements, twisting and shaking all
in their wake: [[[[[rfire], [[[[[bwater], [[[[[uearth], [[[[[Bair], [[[[[wice], [[[[[omagma],
[[[[[Uconfusion], [[[[[Ddark], [[[[[Rsmoke], [[[[[gooze], [[[[[sslowness], [[[[[Gtime], and 
[[[[[vchaos].

           *** Hulking figures (X, Y) ***

These are strange hulking shapes that puzzle anyone who
comes across them. They include the [[[[[sXaren], the [[[[[uXorn],
[[[[[UUmber hulk], [[[[[DDeath hulk], [[[[[wWhite hulk], [[[[[oOrange hulk], [[[[[rFire] 
[[[[[rhulk], [[[[[gForest hulk], [[[[[bNight hulk], [[[[[WSilver hulk], [[[[[vChaos hulk],
[[[[[yYellow hulk], [[[[[RRed hulk], [[[[[GGreen hulk], and [[[[[Bblue hulk]. The 
[[[[[sSasquatch] and [[[[[wYeti] resemble humans, but they are still
quite strange.

            *** Zephyr Hounds (Z) ***

They are dog-like figures wreathed in the elements. They 
tend to move in packs, and are among the most vicious of
all dungeon dwellers. The hounds may be: [[[[[Bclear], [[[[[rfire],
[[[[[benergy], [[[[[gair], [[[[[wcold], [[[[[sacid], [[[[[vmulti-hued], [[[[[Ddark], [[[[[olight],
[[[[[uearth], [[[[[Baquatic], [[[[[vnexus], [[[[[rwater], [[[[[Rplasma], [[[[[yvibration],
[[[[[vchaos], [[[[[Gnether], [[[[[uimpact], [[[[[Winertia], [[[[[Ugravity], [[[[[Gethereal],
[[[[[Btime], and [[[[[vaether].
