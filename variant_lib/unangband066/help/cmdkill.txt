 [1] 'Grid' mode allows you to select any target using the movement keys.
 
 [2] If you have allies, they will attack this monster.  Allies with
 ranged attacks will stand back from the monster and attack it with their
 ranged attacks.  Allies without ranged attacks will go to the monster. If
 the monster moves, allies will continue to follow it, as long as the
 monster stays visible to you.
 
 If you target a grid without a monster, allies will go to the grid.
 Note the difference between this and 'a' assaulting a grid.
 
 [3] This computes the lowest cost path to the grid, and then begins
 'running' the player towards the grid. If the path is too long, or no
 current path can be computed, you will hear a 'beep' and nothing will
 happen.
 
 [4] If you have allies, they will 'assault' this grid.  Allies with
 ranged attacks will stand back from the grid and attack monsters near
 it with their ranged attacks.  Allies without ranged attacks will go to
 the grid.
 
 [5] If you have allies, they will seek out monsters of the same race as
 this monster, in preference to all others.
