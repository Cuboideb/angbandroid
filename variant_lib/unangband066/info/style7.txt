=== The Reforging of Elendil ===

"The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and
on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between
the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was
written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to
war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that sword
when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly
in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was
hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it
Anduril, Flame of the West."

Learn the lesson of Elendil well and do not rely on the edge
of your killing blade, for while it may draw red blood or
black ichor or ash from many of the minions of Morgoth,
against some opponents: those rocky hard or metallic or
stone, your edge will not find purchase and it will be as
if you had shattered your own sword for all the effect it
may have against them.  Carry a blunt weapon for those
circumstances, which will be able to crack through the
hard exterior to damage them without dulling the edge of
your blade.  And then you too will live to find a blade as
great and true as Elendil.
