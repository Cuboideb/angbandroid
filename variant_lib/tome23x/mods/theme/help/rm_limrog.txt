#####GDescription
Humanoid creatures with gill slits at the necks. They can
survive underwater for extended periods of time, and with 
sufficient experience, they'll learn to breathe without any
air at all. Somewhat weak and sickly, they are highly agile
and masters of the Conveyance, Temporal, and Meta schools of
magic. They also have several special abilities that enable
them to disappear and reappear at will.
