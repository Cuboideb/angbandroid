#####GDescription
Demons are minor servants of the Dark. They are natural creatures
that have been corrupted and twisted by Melkor to serve his ends.
All demons have an intrinsic understanding of the forces of Dark,
they resist darkness and fear, and have a firm hold on their life
forces. Most of a demon's ability depends on their subrace, of 
which there are ten. As a corrupted race, demons will gain and 
lose corruptions randomly as they gain experience.
