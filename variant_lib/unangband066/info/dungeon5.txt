=== A Heartfelt Love Letter ===

To Mrs Maggot,

I'll be out in the fields all day again.  As always,
I'm looking forward to your home cooking, especially
your mushroom pie with a nice cold pint of cider.

Don't stay up for me, I'll be home at sundown.  Have
you seen the dogs?  I'm in two minds about them now:
that new one seems to have got a wild side to him and
if I find they've jumped the fence and are chasing
the neighbour's sheep again, I may have to lock them
in the cellar.

Yours,


Mr Maggot
