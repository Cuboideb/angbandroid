                *** Orcs (o) ***

Squat, swarthy creatures rumoured to have been Elves once.
The [[[[[Usnotlings] and [[[[[osnaga] are the lowest form of Orc, weak
but dangerous in packs. There are different breeds of Orc,
depending on their dwelling-place: [[[[[uHill orcs], [[[[[GCave orcs],
and [[[[[Dblack orcs]. The [[[[[sHalf-orcs] are a cross-breed of Orcs
and humans. The [[[[[BUruk-hai] are a stronger breed, they can 
bear the light of the sun. The [[[[[wElite] uruks are the most
dangerous kind of Orc there is.

                *** Ogres (O) ***

Monstrous and destructive creatures of legend and folklore.
The [[[[[wOgrillon] is a cross-breed of an Orc and an Ogre, and
the [[[[[oHalf-ogre] is a cross between an Ogre and a human. The
garden-variety [[[[[UOgres] are more common than their [[[[[gForest]-
dwelling, [[[[[sMountain]-dwelling, and [[[[[uCave]-dwelling cousins.
The [[[[[DBlack ogres] shy away from the sun, the [[[[[BMerrows] live
in or near water. There are some [[[[[yRebel ogres] who have 
turned against their plundering fellows and will try to aid
adventurers.

               *** Giants (P) ***

Enormous humanoids with powerful muscles, aligned with evil.
There are [[[[[WStone giants], [[[[[BStorm giants], [[[[[rFire giants], [[[[[wFrost] 
[[[[[wgiants], and [[[[[UHill giants] - while very large and dangerous,
they pale in comparison to the much stronger [[[[[uCyclops], [[[[[bCloud] 
[[[[[bgiants], and the terrifying [[[[[sRock giants]. The [[[[[yLesser titans]
and [[[[[oGreater titans] are in a class of their own, their power
and magical abilities unmatched by any. The [[[[[RRebel giants] are
those who have broken with the forces of Darkness.

               *** Trolls (T) ***

Lumbering evil creatures originated in mockery of the Ents.
The [[[[[UHalf-trolls] are bizarre crosses between trolls and Men.
The [[[[[uCave-trolls], [[[[[wSnow-trolls], [[[[[sHill trolls], [[[[[gForest trolls],
[[[[[BWater trolls], and [[[[[WStone trolls] are dangerous and usually
move in large groups. Even more dangerous are the [[[[[oAlgroths],
the [[[[[yOlog-hai], and the [[[[[BScrags]. The [[[[[RWar trolls], [[[[[rEldraks], and
[[[[[bEttins] can only be described as killing machines.

                *** Yeeks (y) ***

Small humanoid figures whose origin lies outside Middle-earth.
There are [[[[[Bblue], [[[[[ubrown], [[[[[Ddark], [[[[[wwhite], [[[[[sgray], and [[[[[yyellow]
Yeeks. The [[[[[gmaster yeeks] are somewhat proficient at magic, and
[[[[[Uadventurer yeeks] will try to help you.
