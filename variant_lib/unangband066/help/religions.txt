=== Religions ===

    There are a number of different religions in Middle-Earth, or at least, a
    number of different greater powers which those who practise the religions
    arts from Prayer Books can dedicate themselves to.
    
    The Prayer book you start with, and the prayer books you find stocked in
    the shops will be based on the god you worship, although you are capable
    of learning spells from any religion.  Think of the religions more as a
    dedication to a particular power and complementing set of spells than a
    particular requirement, although each god does have its strengths and
    weaknesses and secrets they keep from each other.

    Note that the religions are currently under development and it is
    strongly recommended that you choose Mandos to start with - if you are
    presented with a choice at all.  The other religions do not yet have the
    full, balanced and intended prayer set beyond the starting books.

***** <Mandos>
        Mandos
           The followers of Mandos gain the most flexible spell selection
           for defense and a broad and powerful range of direct offensive
           spells, without forfeitting either healing or detection arts.
           
           Followers of Mandos start with the prayer book of Castigations.
