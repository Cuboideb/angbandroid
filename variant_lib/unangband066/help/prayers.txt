=== Prayer Specialists ===

    There are two types of prayer book specialists: those who are solely
    dedicated to a particular religion, and those who specialise in the
    a more narrow path of devotion than a single religion. Both types of
    specialists are more effective at making prayers in their specialist
    area, at the cost of not being able to learn as widely as generalist
    priests, in addition to the standard experience penalty for specialists.
    
    There are a number of different religions in Middle-Earth, or at least, a
    number of different greater powers which those who practise the religions
    arts from Prayer Books can dedicate themselves to. The Prayer book you
    start with, and the prayer books you find stocked in the shops will be
    based on the religion you select - if you are a religous specialist this
    will be the same as the religion you specialise in.
    
    Those who devote themselvs to a narrower path gain their benefits only
    for a limited number of prayers in their religion - those which match the
    particular path of study they have chosen. For instance, a Mandos specialist
    in Abjuration will get the benefits of speciality from their starting
    Detect Evil spell, but not towards their Benediction spell. A path
    specialist is free to choose any religion, but some religions start with
    more prayers which benefit from the speciality than others.
    
    There is one prayer book for each path specialist which contains all of the
    spells they have specialised in: these books can only be located in
    the dungeon, or certain stores which can only be found late in the game.
    
    Both religious and path specialists are restricted from learning or browsing
    the books of other religions, although the 'dungeon' books can be learned from
    by any priest or prayer book user.

    Note that the religions are currently under development and it is
    strongly recommended that you choose Mandos to start with - if you are
    presented with a choice at all.  The other religions do not yet have the
    full, balanced and intended prayer set beyond the starting books.
