=== Musings from an Old Duellist to the Younger ===

"The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for
the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him.
And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what
uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic
is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this
quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man."

There is no greater interplay than the conversation of a test
of arms, no more cutting a wit, nor more challenging reparte.
You will find the best weapons suited to this style light and
easy to grip and swing in one hand, while the other stays
free to balance you, to grab or push away the opponent if he
overswings, to tumble obstacles in the environment around you
onto him.  Do not favour either edged or blunt weapons, but
carry one of both types on you to better match a variety of
opponents.  And choose nothing heavier than a Bastard Sword
(or the rumoured Blade of Chaos), a Lead-filled Mace or a
Halberd for your dueling tools and these will serve you well.
