=== Welcome to Unangband ===

You begin your adventure on the town level where you may acquire supplies,
weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop owners.
Then you descend into the depths of Unangband, where you will explore the
many levels of the dungeon, gaining experience by killing fierce creatures,
collecting powerful objects and valuable treasure, and returning to town to
barter for new supplies.  Eventually, as you become more experienced, you
may attempt to win the game by defeating Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness,
who resides far below the surface.

Note that Unangband is a very complex game, and it may be difficult to grasp
everything at first, especially if you have never played a "roguelike" game
before.  To assist you, notes like this will occasionally appear around the
dungeon, explaining various aspects of the game.  To get additional
help and advice, you can press ? when the game is waiting for a command
and browse through all of the "online help files".

You can begin the game by pressing ESC to leave this screen, and using the
movement keys to move around the town. Depending on the choice you made at
the start of the game, you'll either use the number pad or certain letter
keys on your keyboard to move, as follows:

        Original Keyset Directions       Roguelike Keyset Directions
