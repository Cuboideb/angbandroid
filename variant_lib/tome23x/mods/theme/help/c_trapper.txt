#####R=== Trappers ===

#####GDescription
A Pacifist is someone who prefers not to use violence to 
achieve their ends. The trappers are not averse, however,
to destroying monsters via traps and using corpses they
find to create totems in order to summon aid. They 
may also use spells provided by their deities.
