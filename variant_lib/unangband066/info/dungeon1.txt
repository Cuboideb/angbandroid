=== Your Home Town ===

Once you are satisfied with your purchases, you should visit the house
marked by '8' to store any excess equipment, thereby declaring this town 
your home.  Stores will only restock for you in your home town; 
elsewhere merchants will show you the same wares every time you call upon.  
Even your home town merchants will not take you seriously as long as they 
see you wasting your time travelling around wilderness. 

You'll also discover that it's easy to arrange for the contents of your home 
to move with you, so that you can keep useful items in your home and be sure 
they are available for you from place to place.  You may find other 
non-shop locations in various towns that you can store items in --- 
be assured that these will be there for you upon your return.

=== Travelling through the Wilderness ===

You can also travel through the wilderness to a nearby dungeon in search
of adventure.  Use the travel command ('<') when you are on the surface
and choose wisely an area that promises treasure and fame, not instant death.
The higher the level of the location, the higher the danger.

After you travel a little, you'll see dungeon entrances marked as '>'.
To enter a dungeon, stand on the entrance and use the climb down 
command ('>').  Remember to bring a light source with you 
and light it up ('|') before you descend, or you may be ambushed.

You can climb back up using the climb up command ('<') if you find 
a set of stairs up within the dungeon.  To save time, when you arrive 
at a town that has a dungeon in it, you'll start on the entrance.
In the wilderness though, you'll have to explore a little to find 
the dungeon entrance.
