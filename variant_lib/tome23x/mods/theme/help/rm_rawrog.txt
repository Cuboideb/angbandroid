#####R=== Rawroeg (Lion Demons) ===

#####GDescription
Tall humanoids with glorious red-gold hair and decidedly
catlike faces, the Rawroeg are corrupted lions. Strong,
healthy, intelligent and wise, they fear very little and
can emit roars that instill fear into the very souls of 
their enemies. They learn to resist the elements fairly 
well as they gain experience. They make good warriors.
