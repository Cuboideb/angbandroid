#####R === FuryMod Powers - Knowledge School ===

The knowledge school of magic contains spells where magic is used to 
psychically gain information about things. There are rumours of a "Tome of 
Knowledge" which contains all the divination school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar also gives the ability to cast spells from
the knowledge school at a level of 2/3 of your prayer level. e.g. If the 
skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast up to level 8 
divination school spells.
