#####R=== Red Dragons ===

#####GDescription
These dragons are utterly in command of the element of fire.
Not only are they surrounded by a fiery blaze, but they learn
to withstand the effects of fire entirely as they become more
experienced. They are also able to draw upon their master 
element to become even stronger as they mature. They can 
breathe fire and they have access to the Fire school of magic.
