=== Writing on the inside of your shield ===

"Search for the seed of good in every adversity. Master that
principle and you will own a precious shield that will guard
you well through all the darkest valleys you must traverse.
Stars may be seen from the bottom of a deep well, when they
cannot be discerned from the mountaintop. So will you learn
things in adversity that you would never have discovered
without trouble. There is always a seed of good. Find it and
prosper."

Keep your shield wielded at all times and the strength of
this will guide you through dark places.

                                   -- Old saying.
