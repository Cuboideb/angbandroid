#####R=== Ascetics ===

#####GDescription
An Ascetic is a monk who has forsaken all worldly
things, including deity worship and magic. Ascetics
must survive by their fists and their natural
ability to resist magic. Despite not worshipping any
gods, Ascetics are highly spiritual, and can achieve
excellent saving throws in addition to their magic-
repelling abilities.
