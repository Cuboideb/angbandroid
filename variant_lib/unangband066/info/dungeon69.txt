=== Entering the Dungeon ===

Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light, armor, and
weapons, he is ready to enter the dungeon.  Move on top of the `>' symbol
and use the "Down" command (">").  Remember to light up ('|') your light 
source before you descend, or you may be eaten by a Grey ogre!

Your character will enter a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
arrive somewhere on the first level of the dungeon.  Each level of the
dungeon is fifty feet high (thus dungeon level "Lev 1" is often called
"50 ft"), and is divided into (large) rectangular regions (several times
larger than what fits on the screen) by granite walls.  Once you leave 
a level by a staircase, you will never again find your way back 
to that region of that level, but there are an infinite number 
of other regions at that same "depth" that you can explore later.  
So be careful that you have found all the treasure before you leave a level, 
or you may never find it again!  The monsters, of course, can use the stairs, 
and you may eventually encounter them again.
