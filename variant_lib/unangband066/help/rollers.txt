=== Rolling up Stats ===

You will now have the oppotunity to determine your stats in more
detail.  If you choose to just roll, you'll be able to simulate
a sequence of dice rolls to generate your stats.  Unangband
ensures that there is a minimum and maximum cut off so that just
rolling will provide a useful range.

Alternately, you can use a point based method, where you trade
stats amongst each other, and can sacrifice or earn starting
gold instead.  Finally, you can use the auto-roller to specify
minimum stats.  Note that the stat rolls are not independent of
each other due to the cutoff calculations made earlier, so it
may be that the stat range you specify in the auto-roller may
not be achievable no matter how many iterations you run.
