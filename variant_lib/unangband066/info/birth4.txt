=== Equipment and Inventory ===

Your character will begin his adventure with some basic supplies, and some
extra gold with which to purchase more supplies at the town stores.  To see
what you currently are carrying, you can use the inventory ('i') and
equipment ('e') commands.  Items in your equipment affect your current
status: armour that you wear increases or decreases your armour class (AC).
You use the wield command ('w') to wear or wield an item into your equip-
ment, and the take off command ('t' or 'T' in the roguelike keyset) to
remove an item from your equipment and put it into your inventory.

You can evaluate how useful an object is by examinining it ('x' or letter
'O' in the roguelike keyset).  The amount of gold you are carrying is shown
by the AU number at the bottom of the screen or while in a store.

It is recommended that you buy some additional potions of Cure Light Wounds
and scrolls of Phase Door before entering the dungeon.  With any left over
money buy enough torches to carry around 10 of them.  Have a look 
at each of the stores to see if and where you can find these.
