#####R=== Easterlings ===

#####GDescription
From the time of the Dagor Bragollach, the Easterlings have stood as
the treacherous race of men. Swarthy and stout, these humans cannot
be stunned, get a penchant for landing on their feet, and are not
confused easily, once they have gained some experience. They are equally 
good at all kinds of weapons, being trained in combat from an early age. 
They do not trust magic, however, and have little skill in it.
