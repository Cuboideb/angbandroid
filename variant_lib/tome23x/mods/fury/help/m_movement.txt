#####R === FuryMod Powers - Movement School ===

The movement school of magic contains spells where the forces of space are
manipulated by the spell. There are rumours of a "Tome of of Translocation"
which contains all the movement school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Manwe Sulimo also gives the ability to cast spells from
the movement school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. e.g. If the
skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5
movement school spells.
