=== Styles ===

        Each classes may choose to specialise in a particular style for a
        10% additional experience penalty in return for getting a bonus in
        differing situations.
        
        Note to Angband players: Some classes, notably Rangers and Priests
        are less powerful than the Vanilla Angband characters but may choose
        to regain their former abilities through particular choices of styles.
        To match the Angband classes, you must choose the Hafted speciality
        for Priests and the Bow speciality for Rangers. 
        To compensate, non-specialised Rangers and Priests have less of an
        experience penalty than their Vanilla counterparts.

        The styles confer a number of different benefits as explained below.
        The rate of progress of these abilities can vary with each class.

***** <Magic books>
***** <Prayer books>
        Magic Books / Prayer Books

                Many spell casters devote an themselves to the in depth pursuit
                of a particular magical type. Styling themselves Geomancers,
                Necromancers, Illusionists or otherwise, they have
                a deep understanding of a particular style of magic. Each
                spell book contains the creations of the greatest mages in
                the particular field.
                
                Others have no natural spell casting ability, but have been
                gifted with an ability or have a natural talent for 
                a particular type of magic, and limited mastery of magic 
                in this particular area only.

                If the character would not normally have the ability to cast
                spells, they instead gain a limited amount of mana 
                and the ability to learn and cast spells from a single 
                magic book or school of magic.  Specialised spell casters 
                who could normally cast spells, can instead cast spells 
                from their specialised book or school of magic at roughly 
                twice the effective power of a non-specialised mage, 
                and learns them approximately 20% earlier.

***** <Amulets>
        Amulets
                Amulet specialists have a thorough knowledge of magical
                talismans and the relationship between the materials used in
                these devices and the magic they manifest.  Amulet specialists
                may identify simple amulets as they see them, and slowly
                improve in the range of magical amulets identified at higher
                levels.  They can also wear a second amulet and activate 
                the magic contained in their amulets for bigger effect.
                Fighters are known to set up amulets as an extra protection 
                for their chests.

                addition, the effects of wands they use or set in traps is

                addition, the effects of staves they use or set in traps is
                increased at up to 3 times the damage that a non-specialist
                benefits from, and they may gain an advantage to hit and damage
                and additional blows at higher levels when using a staff in
                combat.

        Potions
                Potion specialists have a sound understanding of the physical
                and magical principles behind the reagents required for magic
                potions. They may identify simple potions as they encounter
                them, and slowly improve in the complexity of potions
                identified at higher levels.  In addition, potion specialists
                have access to a system of alchemical formulas that allows them
                to re-write the effects of potions effects when using a potion
                as a grenade.  This system of alchemical formulas requires
                significant study and experimentation.

        Scrolls
                Scroll specialists have a deep knowledge of ancient and modern
                magical writings and how they relate to the underlying spell
                processes. They may identify simple scrolls as they see
                them, and slowly improve in the range of magical scrolls
                identified at higher levels.  In addition, the effects of

                of metals, minerals and settings required for magical jewelry
                such as rings.  Jewelers may identify simple rings, improving
                in the number of types identified at higher levels. 
                They can also wear three rings at once and activate the magic
                of some rings with greater power.  Fighters used to magic rings
                on their fingers will find their grip on weapons less sure 
                when no rings are worn.

***** <Instruments>

                Instrument specialists may wield musical instruments of a
                variety of types to improve the power of particular songs. It
                is believed that there is one effective musical instrument for
                each type of bardic song book, that can be used in conjunction
                with any spell cast from either the song book or the equivalent
                magic or prayer book that also contains it.
