=== Schools ===

    There are a number of different schools of thought as to how magic should
    be instructed, and these are reflected in seven different schools of magic
    that can be learnt by those classes who use Magic books.
    
    The Magic book you start with, and the magic books you find stocked in
    the shops will be based on the school of magic you select, although you
    are capable of learning spells from any school.  Think of the schools more
    as a methodology and complementing set of spells than a particular
    requirement, although each school does have its strengths and weaknesses
    and secrets they keep from each other.

    Note to Angband players: For a 'vanilla' mage experience, it is recommended
    that you choose the school of Wizardry to start with.
        
***** <Wizardry>
        Wizardry
           The school of Wizardry contains the most flexible spell selection
           for defense and a broad and powerful range of direct offensive
           spells.  Wizardry has few weaknesses: no reliable method of
           satisfying a wizard's hunger and few spells that can be used to
           attack an enemy without putting the wizard in harm's way.  Wizards
           should be thoughtful in offense and quick to escape or evade an
           enemy that exhausts the resources at their disposal.
           
           Aspiring Wizards start with the book of Cantrips.
        
***** <Druidry>
        Druidry
           The school of Druidry contains a wide variety of different spells,
           include a good low level offense, but is hampered by difficult to
           use defensive spells and offensive magic that takes a while to get
           going and may leave the Druid in close proximity to harm should 
           they fail to work.  A Druid operates best when he is able to
           prepare the ground upon which he fights, and works best in open
           spaces: conjuring trees, calling forth lightning and fire and so
           on.  This is also the Druid's weakness: he must operate in the
           open, and takes a while to prepare his magic, which means he can
           be overwhelmed before his magic can be used. 

           Novice Druids start with the book of Hedges.

***** <Mastery>
        Mastery
          The school of Mastery contains some useful low-level magics, but at
          higher levels is heavily reliant on the ability to summon and control
          minions for the great part of both offense and defense.  This is
          a double-edged sword: while the minions are more than capable of
          providing the Master protection and dealing out damage, he has a
          heavy investment in them, and will have to pay a 'mana debt' or
          'blood debt' should they be destroyed.  This reliance on minions
          means that the tables can turn very quickly on the Master and get
          out of control.
          
          Wouldbe Masters start with the book of Curses.
        
***** <Sorcery>
        Sorcery
          The school of Sorcery is both deceptively weak and strong.  A 
          Sorcerer lacks the immediate damage dealing capacity of the Wizard
          and the long term damage capability of the Druid, and does not have
          the same range of minions as the Master.  The Sorcerer's spells and
          minions are useful in preparing the ground like the Druid, in
          particular with a range of traps and mimics, and enraging and
          drawing in the enemy.  But his abilities to ensorcle perhaps any
          enemy, will give him opportunities and gambits far greater than
          the Master is capable of.
          
          Neophyte Sorcerers start with the book of Glamours.
        
***** <Thaumaturgy>
        Thaumaturgy
          The school of Thaumaturgy contains the widest range of direct
          offensive spells, to allow a thaumaturgist to find and exploit the
          weakness of any opposition.  The Thaumaturgical energies at his
          disposal randomly vary from individual to individual, and as a 
          result, the exact spell selection will vary.  The weakness of the
          Thaumaturgist is a distinct lack of flexibility in defense: with
          limited and hard to use escapes and utility magics.
               
          Latent Thaumaturges start with the book of Fireworks.

***** <Science>
        Science
          The school of Science concentrates on sensing and divining the
          nature of threats around the Scientist and defusing and neutralising
          those threats before they are realised.

          The school of Science has particular affinity for Artisans and
          Artisans should usually choose this school in order to get the best
          selection of spells in the least number of different books.
          Mages or Warrior Mages who specialise in this school will find that
          it has no offensive spells at early levels, which makes it a very
          difficult school for them to adopt.
          
          Amateur Scientists start with the book of Trades. 

***** <Statecraft>
        Statecraft
          The school of Statecraft concentrates on supplementing the natural
          abilities of the Statesman, to allow him to track the enemy,
          entrap and encircle them, and ultimately wage cruel war on them
          if required.

          The school of Statecraft has particular affinity for Rangers and
          Rangers should usually choose this school in order to get the best
          selection of spells in the least number of different books.
          Mages or Warrior Mages who specialise in this school will find that
          it has no offensive spells at early levels, which makes it a very
          difficult school for them to adopt.

          Beginning Statesmen start with the book of Trailcraft.

***** <Spellstealing>
        Spellstealing
          The school of Spellstealing concentrates on misdirection and
          manipulation of enemies, allowing the spell caster to avoid those
          they don't wish to confront, while thieving from and disposing of
          those that are more lucrative prospects. 
          
          The school of Spellstealing has particular affinity for Rogues and
          Rogues should usually choose this school in order to get the best
          selection of spells in the least number of different books.
          Mages or Warrior Mages who specialise in this school will find that
          it has no offensive spells at early levels, which makes it a very
          difficult school for them to adopt.

          Apprentice Spellstealers start with the book of Tricks.
