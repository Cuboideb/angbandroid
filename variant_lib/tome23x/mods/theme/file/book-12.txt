                *** Cattle (c) ***

Mostly domesticated four-legged beasts of burden, these
animals will not bother you unless you bother them first.
In fact, [[[[[wSheep], [[[[[uCows], [[[[[sHorses], [[[[[WMearas], [[[[[yPonies], [[[[[DOxen],
[[[[[rKine of Araw], and [[[[[UDeer] will tend to ignore adventurers
completely. [[[[[oBoars], however, are a different matter. They
have strong legs and fierce tusks, which they will use 
against anyone who stumbles into their territory.

                *** Canines (C) ***

Four-legged animals with shaggy fur. Most of them are not
very dangerous - in fact, the [[[[[sScruffy little dogs] will 
not do much except growl, and [[[[[yJackals] can be deadly against
very weak adventurers, but will not hold their own against
even moderately experienced ones. [[[[[oFoxes], [[[[[uWolves], [[[[[wWhite] 
[[[[[wwolves], and [[[[[BBlink dogs] can be a nuisance, but not overmuch.
The evil [[[[[gWolf chieftains], [[[[[DWerewolves], [[[[[DWargs], [[[[[RHellhounds],
and [[[[[rGreater Hellhounds], however, are very dangerous.

                *** Felines (f) ***

Lithe, four-legged animals with sleek fur and sharp claws.
The [[[[[WScrawny cat] lives in the town and tends to walk by 
itself. The [[[[[UWild cats], [[[[[gTree cats], and [[[[[bNight cats] are all
quite menacing, but only dangerous in packs. The powerful
[[[[[DPanthers], [[[[[oTigers], [[[[[wSnow tigers], and [[[[[ySabre-tooth tigers]
are not to be toyed with. The [[[[[uLeopards] and [[[[[RLions] are the 
strongest of all the feline monsters.

              *** Quadrupeds (q) ***

Four-legged creatures of varying breeds, these monsters 
are all quite large and fierce - their bulk alone is 
enough to intimidate you. The weakest are the [[[[[yApes], who
make a lot of noise but aren't very dangerous. The [[[[[WOld] 
[[[[[Wbears] just want everyone to leave them alone. There are 
many other different kinds of bears, among them the 
[[[[[uCave bears], [[[[[rWar bears], [[[[[UGrizzly bears], [[[[[wPolar bears], 
[[[[[bBlue bears], [[[[[RFire bears], [[[[[BAquatic bears], and [[[[[DWerebears].
The [[[[[sMumakil] are gigantic elephantine forms, stomping all
over the dungeon and waving their tusks threateningly. The
[[[[[GNight mares] are fearsome skeletal horses with glowing eyes.
The [[[[[gCatoblepas] are strange ox-like forms with huge heads but
thin, weak necks. The [[[[[oRust monsters] are weird, small animals
that look perpetually hungry.

                 *** Birds (B) ***

There are many different types of birds on Middle-earth,
and the [[[[[RChaffinches], [[[[[WSparrows], [[[[[BNightingales], [[[[[UThrushes],
[[[[[WRavens], [[[[[oGulls], [[[[[rEagles], and [[[[[rGreat eagles] will not harm
anyone who does not harm them first. The [[[[[wSwans] hold a very
special place with the Valar, and woe be to anyone who 
knowingly harms a Swan. However, not all birds are harmless.
The [[[[[RKirinki] can wake up entire towns with their shrill cry,
The [[[[[sCrows] and [[[[[DCrebain] are ever hungry for carrion, as are
[[[[[GGorcrows]. The [[[[[uHunting hawks] seek prey without regard for 
friend or foe. The [[[[[DWinged Horrors] are not quite birds, they 
are Great Eagles corrupted by Morgoth to serve his ends.
