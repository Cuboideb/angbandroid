=== The Saga of Helm Hammerhand ===

"I think it is time we inform the senate that our ability to 
use the force has diminished."

Helm Hammerhand was the ninth King of Rohan and last King
of the first line and at war with the Dunlendings over a
man he had slain with a single blow of his fist.  The
siege of Helm's forces in the Deep lasted through the long
winter, their supplies were low and they were desperate. Helm
began to launch sorties alone against the Dunlendings, wear-
ing white clothing and under the cover of storms he would
go into their camps and slay the enemy with his bare hands.
So ferocious were his attacks that the Dunlendings began to
believe that, as he bore no weapons, no weapons could hurt
him. Before each sortie he would blow the great horn of the
Hornburg, which echoed through the deep, and the Dunlendings
learned to fear his coming. One night the great horn echoed
through the deep and Helm left, and did not return. When the
sun rose the body of Helm was found frozen in the snow where
he stood, knees unbent.  Even after his death the Rohirrim
believed that his wraith continued to stalk their enemies
and kill men with fear.

Helm had encountered a beast in the wilderness that had
resisted his hammer blows: something permeable and wraith-
like through which his swinging fists would pass.  Take heed
of this lesson and while the strength of your hammer blows
should stun and bludgeon almost all against you, carry an
edged weapon: an axe, spear or blade, in case you encounter
Helm's foes in the wintery mists of the unending night below.
Or even, forbid the possibility, Helm himself.
