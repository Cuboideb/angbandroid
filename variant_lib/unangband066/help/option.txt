=== Option Descriptions ===

Most of the "options" are accessible through the '=' command, which provides
an interface to the various "sets" of options available to the player.
In the decriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary
which is shown on the "options" screen, plus the internal name of the
option in brackets, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref files
(*.prf) to force the option to a given setting, see "command.txt" 
for more info. You can save your options to a  file using the 'A' command 
and load with the 'L' command. The 'R' command resets all your options 
to defaults (this does not change pref files). 

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including "disturb",
(cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are in progress),
"flush" (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including any
macros in progress), "fresh" (dump any pending output to the screen), and
"sub-windows" (see below).


=== Interface options ===

***** <use_sound>
Use sound    [use_sound]
     Turns on sound effects, if your system supports them.

***** <rogue_like_commands>
Rogue-like commands    [rogue_like_commands]
     Selects the "roguelike" command set (see "command.txt" for info).

***** <use_old_target>
Use old target by default    [use_old_target]
     Forces all commands which normally ask for a "direction" to use the
     current "target" if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous
     if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

***** <pickup_always>
Always pickup items                           [pickup_always]
***** <pickup_inven>
Always pickup items matching inventory        [pickup_inven]
     If pickup_always is on, all items are always picked up, providing it is
     safe to do so.  If pickup_inven is on, then items matching those in your
     inventory are always picked up.

***** <pickup_detail>
Be verbose when picking things up     [pickup_detail]
     If this is off, you get a one-line description of the objects or piles on
     the floor after the other pickup options have acted.  If this option is
     on, you get a full list for more than one item, including weights.

     In either case, you can start picking things up by typing "g".
     When standing still, you are never charged extra time for picking
     up objects.  When walking, you always take a second partial turn to
     pick up objects; each object picked up takes 1/10th of a turn.

***** <easy_alter>
Open/Disarm doors/traps on movement.     [easy_alter]
     Moving into a closed door will attempt once to open it, and moving
     into a trap will attempt once to disarm it. If the player ever wishes
     to leave a known teleport trap as a guaranteed escape route, this
     option must therefore be off.

***** <easy_open>
Open/Disarm/Close without direction     [easy_open]
     If there is only one closed door next to the character, the game will
     not bother asking for a direction when the player asks to "o"pen
     something. The same applies for "c"losing doors and "D"isarming traps.

***** <show_lists>
Always show lists     [show_lists]

***** <easy_autos>
Automatically inscribe all objects     [easy_autos]
     Whenever you inscribe or uninscribe an object, all objects of the same
     kind will be inscribed or uninscribed, including objects that are
     subsequently created. To edit this, use the ~ command and display the
     objects or ego items you wish to modify. You can then modify
     the auto-inscriptions, and save them to a preference file.

***** <easy_search>
Start searching if not disturbed     [easy_search]
     After 20 turns without being disturbed, the character will automatically 
     enter Search mode.

***** <depth_in_feet>
Show dungeon level in feet     [depth_in_feet]
     Display dungeon depths in "feet" instead of "levels".


=== Display options ===

***** <hilite_player>
Hilite the player with the cursor     [hilite_player]
     Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some Unix
     machines, but horrible on most graphics machines.  Note that only some
     machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, hiding
     the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.

***** <center_player>
Center map continuously (very slow)     [center_player]
     The map always centres on the player with this option on. With it off, it
     is divided into 25 sections, with coordinates (0,0) to (4,4), and will
     show one section at a time.

***** <show_piles>
Show stacks using special attr/character     [show_piles]

***** <show_flavors>
Show flavors in object descriptions     [show_flavors]
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions, even for
     objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in stores.

***** <view_flavors>
Show flavors in object graphics     [view_flavors]
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions, even for
     objects whose type is known when using graphical tiles.

***** <show_labels>
Show labels in equipment listings     [show_labels]
     Display "labels" (what an object is being used for) for objects in all
     "equipment" listings.

***** <view_yellow_lite>
Use special colors for torch-lit grids     [view_yellow_lite]
     This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in
     certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
     Turning this option off will slightly improve game speed.

***** <view_bright_lite>
Use special colors for 'viewable' grids     [view_bright_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids
    in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    When this option is set, floor grids which are normally drawn in "white"
    but which are not currently "viewable" by the player are instead drawn
    in "dark gray".  This makes the "viewable" grids to appear "brighter"
    than the others, allowing the player to easily determine which floor
    grids are in "line of sight".  Turning this option off will probably
    increase the speed of the game.

***** <view_granite_lite>
Use special colors for wall grids (slow)     [view_granite_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids which
    are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally are).  When
    the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit,
    we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option,
    else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line
    of sight, or the grid is dark, or the grid is only "partially" lit, then
    we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white".  Turning this option
    off will probably increase the speed of the game.  This option may not
    work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed, or
    if "graphics" are being used.

***** <view_special_lite>
Use special colors for floor grids (slow)     [view_special_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids which
    are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are).  When the player is
    blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow"
    (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the grid
    is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the "view_bright_lite" option is
    set, and the grid is not in line of sight, we use "gray", otherwise we
    use the normal "white".  Turning this option off will probably increase
    the speed of the game.  This option may not work well if the attr/char
    codes for walls/veins have been changed, or if "graphics" are being used.

***** <view_perma_grids>
Map remembers all perma-lit grids     [view_perma_grids]
    Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids
    were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids,
    unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids.  Turning off this option
    allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line
    of sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite"
    option.  Note that any non-floor grids which are seen by the player
    are always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is
    memorized independantly from the memorization of the grid itself.

***** <view_torch_grids>
Map remembers all torch-lit grids     [view_torch_grids]
    Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids
    have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use
    of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of
    floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray", "lit"
    grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is
    set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in "orange".
    Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are considered to be
    "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the "view_yellow_lite"
    option is set, in which case they are drawn in "yellow".

***** <view_glowing_lite>
Use special colors for glowing lite (slow)     [view_glowing_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "glowing" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    Glowing grids are grids adjacent to permanently glowing features such
    as torches, magical lights and lava.
    Turning this option off will improve game speed as the code is somewhat
    less efficient than the other special color options.

***** <show_sidebar>
Show attributes in sidebar     [show_sidebar]
    Display name, race, class, title, statistics, hit points, mana and some
    status information in the sidebar. Setting this to no increases the area
    available on the screen to display the map, and moves most of this
    information to a more compact space at the bottom of the screen.

***** <room_names>
Display room names     [room_names]
     When entering a lit room, the name of the room will be displayed as
     a brief message. Room names can indicate what types of creatures,
     treasures or traps can be encountered in that room.

***** <room_descriptions>
Display room descriptions     [room_descriptions]
     When entering a room, a description of the contents of the room will
     be displayed. If the room is lit, visible features will be noted, 
     otherwise only sounds, wind and temperature will be noticed. 
     The description will not be displayed again, once the room is lit, 
     except by looking at yourself while in the room, or at the contents 
     of the room while outside it. The room description will provide 
     important information about what types of creatures, treasure, 
     traps or magical effects are in the room.

***** <show_tips>
Show tips as you explore the dungeon     [show_tips]


=== Warning and Disturbance options ===

***** <disturb_move>
Disturb whenever any monster moves    [disturb_move]
    Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears.
    This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so
    you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near
    such monsters.

***** <disturb_near>
Disturb whenever viewable monster moves    [disturb_near]
    Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any
    monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any
    viewable monster becomes no longer viewable.  This option ignores
    the existance of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether
    a monster is "viewable".

***** <disturb_detect>
Disturb whenever leaving detected area     [disturb_detect]
    The game will always prompt you to confirm moving from a 'safe' to an
    'unsafe' location, or otherwise interact with an 'unsafe' location
    from a 'safe' location. A 'safe' location is one that has either been
    detected using a detect trap or detect monster spell with the appropriate 
    game-play option set. This option enabled will mean that locations you 
    'notice' will not be marked as safe.

***** <disturb_state>
Disturb whenever player state changes    [disturb_state]
    This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state
    changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

***** <quick_messages>
Activate quick messages    [quick_messages]
    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt
    (useful for monster farming).  Allows most keys to mean "no" to any
    "[y/n]" prompt.

***** <auto_more>
Automatically clear -more- prompts    [auto_more]
    The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more-
    prompt, but carries on going.

***** <ring_bell>
Audible bell (on errors, etc)    [ring_bell]
    Attempts to make a "bell" noise when various "errors" occur.

***** <flush_failure>
Flush input on various failures    [flush_failure]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
    "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand,
    etc.  This is very useful if you use macros which include "directional"
    components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from
    walking towards monsters when your spells fail.

***** <flush_disturb>
Flush input whenever disturbed    [flush_disturb]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
    character is "disturbed".  This is useful if you use macros which take
    time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being
    attacked by a monster.

***** <easy_corpses>
Ignore corpses by default     [easy_corpses]
    The player will not pick up corpses, bones and other junk. Junk can
    still be inscribed with =g to pick it up automatically if required.

***** <easy_more>
Minimise '-more-' prompts     [easy_more]


***** <auto_monlist>
Always show visible monsters/objects     [auto_monlist]
     Automatically show the list of visible monsters and objects whenever
     there is a monster or object visible.
	
***** <easy_monlist>
Spacebar toggles visible monsters/objects     [easy_monlist]
     Allows you to press space to toggle the auto_monlist option and show or
     hide the list of visible monsters and objects.

***** <verify_mana>
Verify critical mana     [verify_mana]
     The game will always prompt you to confirm casting a spell if it
     would leave you with less mana than the Hitpoint warning
     percentage.

***** <view_unsafe_grids>
Mark map where you have detected traps     [view_unsafe_grids]
     Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a detect
     trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This allows you to
     determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect traps, but does not
     ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are trap free. This option
     has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor locations cannot be trapped.

***** <view_detect_grids>
Mark map where you have detected monsters     [view_detect_grids]
     Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a detect
     monster spell of some kind cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This
     allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect
     monster spells, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x'
     are monster free. This option has no effect on surface grids.

***** <autosave>
Create backup savefile before descending     [autosave_backup]
     Before any dungeon level is generated, an additional savefile is created.
     The backup savefile can be found in the same directory as the regular
     savefile and has the additionial '.bkp' suffix.

***** <ally_messages>
Show detailed combat messages for allies    [ally_messages]
     Show all attack messages for allies actions.

=== Birth options ===

***** <birth_randarts>
Randomize some of the artifacts      [birth_randarts]
     A different set of artifacts will be created, in place of the standard
     ones. This is intended primarily for people who have played enough to
     know what most of the standard artifacts do and have got bored with
     them.  Note that savefiles with random artifacts are not guaranteed
     to be compatible between different Angband versions!

***** <birth_ironman>
Restrict the use of stairs/recall     [birth_ironman]
     This option, not recommended for non-advanced players, prevents the
     generation of up staircases, and makes the scroll and effect of Word
     of Recall not function: and teleport-level always goes down, as does
     the spell of stair-creation, except on the quest levels of Sauron and
     Morgoth.

***** <birth_no_stores>
Restrict the use of stores/home     [birth_no_stores]
     The stores are all closed. The home is someone else's, and locked. You
     can keep nothing but what you carry with you, and get nothing but what
     you find in the dungeon. No selling items, or buying potions of
     restore stat... Not recommended for new players, or indeed for
     sane players.

***** <birth_no_selling>
Don't sell to the stores     [birth_no_selling]
     The storekeepers will not buy anything from you, altough you can still
     buy stuff from them.

***** <birth_no_artifacts>
Restrict the creation of artifacts     [birth_no_artifacts]
     No artifacts will be created. Ever. Just *how* masochistic are you?

***** <birth_no_stacking>
Don't stack objects on the floor     [birth_no_stacking]
     Items dropped on the floor will spread out instead of stacking.
     Normal items will disappear if there is no empty grid within a radius
     of three squares.

***** <birth_no_stairs>
Don't generate connected stairs     [birth_no_stairs]
     Never generate a staircase back to the level you came from, if you used
     a staircase to get to the level.

***** <birth_no_identify>
Don't need to identify items     [birth_no_identify]
     All objects will be found fully identified.

***** <birth_lore>
Know complete artifact/ego/monster info     [birth_lore]

***** <birth_auto>
Auto-inscribe items as if known     [birth_auto]

***** <birth_campaign>
Play in Lord of the Rings campaign     [birth_campaign]
     The character will start in Hobbiton, instead of Angband, and be able
     to travel to Rivendell, the Lonely Mountain, Isengard and other
     locations featured in the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings books.
     Be prepared for out of depth uniques (Especially at night), dungeon
     guardians you have to defeat in order to progress further, quest
     rewards in set locations, and dangerous battlefields and towers.

***** <birth_haggle>
Haggle in stores     [birth_haggle]
     Disable haggling in stores, resulting in a ten percent sales tax
     on items which you would have otherwise been forced to haggle for.
     When this option is on, all prices listed in stores will be the
     actual price that you pay for an item, as opposed to shop-keeper's
     initial offer.

***** <birth_beginner>
Start the game with almost no birth choices     [birth_beginner]

***** <birth_intermediate>

***** <birth_gollum>
Play in gollum mode     [birth_gollum]
     Start the game in Mordor on the Plains of Gorgoroth, for advanced

=== Subwindow display settings ===

Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which can be used to
display useful information generally available through other means.  The best
thing about these windows is that they are updated automatically (usually) to
reflect the current state of the world.  The "window options" can be used to
specify what should be displayed in each window.  The possible choices should
be pretty obvious.

Display inven/equip
    Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment).

Display equip/inven
    Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory).

Display player (basic)

Display player (extra)

Display player (compact)

Display player (status)

Display messages
    Display the most recently generated "messages".

Display dungeon map
    Display the area around the player or around the target while
    targetting.  This allows using graphical tiles in their original
    size.

Display overhead view
    Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon.  This is very slow
    and does not even look very good.

Display monster recall
    Display a description of the most monster which has been most recently
    attacked, targetted, or examined in some way.

Display object recall
    Display a description of the most recently selected object.  Currently
    this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks.  This window flag may be
    usefully combined with others, such as "monster recall".

Display feature recall (not used)

Display room description

Display snap-shot (not used)

Display visible monsters

Display help (not used)


=== Left Over Information ===

The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects used
for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal to
"delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.

The "hitpoint_warn" value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints
at which the player is warned that he may die.  It is also used as the cut-off
for using the color red to display both hitpoints and mana.
