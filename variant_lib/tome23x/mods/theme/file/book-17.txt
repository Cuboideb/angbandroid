                *** Mewlips (i) ***

Mewlips are evil cannibal spirits from the marshlands.
They come in different varieties: [[[[[wclear], [[[[[sgray], [[[[[oorange],
[[[[[rbloodshot], [[[[[ggreen], [[[[[bblue], [[[[[ubrown], [[[[[Wstone], [[[[[yyellow], [[[[[Rpink],
[[[[[Gtree], [[[[[Bair], [[[[[Uplague], and [[[[[Ddeath].


                 *** Golems (g) ***

Massive animated statues made from different materials.
There are [[[[[obronze], [[[[[wbone], [[[[[ueog], [[[[[Bmithril], [[[[[siron], [[[[[baquatic],
[[[[[Wstone], [[[[[Uclay], [[[[[Rflesh], and [[[[[ffire golems], in addition to the
more cunning [[[[[ycolbrans], [[[[[DPukelmen], [[[[[gdrolems], [[[[[Gcolossus], and
[[[[[ssilent watchers].

               *** Skeletons (s) ***

There are skeletal forms of just about any monster that once
inhabited Middle-earth. Some such forms, however, have never
been alive in the first place - they are horrible abominations
animated by powerful wizards. Among them are the [[[[[wice skeletons],
[[[[[sflying skulls], [[[[[Dcrypt creeps], [[[[[yhand druj], [[[[[oskull druj], and 
[[[[[reye druj].

                *** Zombies (z) ***

Zombie forms of all living creatures may appear in the dungeons.
However, some zombie-like undead from before the First Age do
exist: [[[[[Ughouls], [[[[[ygreater mummies], [[[[[Dghoulkings], [[[[[ughasts], and
[[[[[Rrotting corpses].

                *** Vampires (V) ***

There are vampire forms of just about any race - [[[[[Whuman], [[[[[Gelf], [[[[[Dorc],
[[[[[wyeek], [[[[[oogre], [[[[[utroll], [[[[[Rdwarf], and [[[[[Bgnome]. The [[[[[sOriental vampires]
come from beyond the land of Rhun. There are [[[[[bVampire lords], [[[[[rElder]
[[[[[rvampires], and [[[[[gMaster vampires]. The [[[[[UAdventurer vampires] are those
who have denounced the way of the Dark and attempt to follow a path
of Light as best they can.
