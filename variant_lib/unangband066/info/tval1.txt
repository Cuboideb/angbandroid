=== Skeletons & Bones ===

Monster remains litter the dungeon and can be used to hint at what
creatures inhabit the level you are currently on. Approximately two thirds
of body parts you find will be from creatures that live on the current
level. If you find rooms littered with bones, this strongly suggests that
hungry creatures that gnaw and rend flesh are near.

Occasionally you will find a skeleton from a creature deeper in the
dungeon - you can 'I'nspect or e'x'amine this to find out some information
about the creature in question, even if you have not previously encountered
it. If the most powerful monster on a level is significantly more dangerous
than other monsters on the level, you will find a lot more remains than you
would otherwise expect to do so, and far less other creatures.

It is also rumoured that powerful magics and magic-users can animate the
bones of departed creatures from the dead into powerful skeletal opponents.
You suspect, with no flesh on their bones, that such creatures would be
resistant to edged weapons, and magically immune to various weaknesses of
the flesh such as poison, cold and electricity.
