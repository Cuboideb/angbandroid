#####R=== Blue Dragons ===

#####GDescription
These dragons are utterly in command of the element of Earth.
As such, they have an innate resistance to electricity, which
with time becomes full immunity, as they can use the power of
the Earth to neutralize electrical discharges. They have access
to the Earth school of magic and can conjure up showers of 
blazing sparks to dazzle their opponents. They are especially
agile and lithe, and their dexterity will increase with experience.
