=== Zangband Commands ===


Zangband commands are entered as an "underlying command" (a single key)
plus a variety of optional or required arguments. You may choose how
the "keyboard keys" are mapped to the "underlying commands" by choosing
one of two standard "keynotes", the "original" keyset or the "roguelike"
keyset.

The original keyset is very similar to the "underlying" command set,
with a few additions (such as the ability to use the numeric
"directions" to "walk" or the "5" key to "stay still"). The roguelike
keyset provides similar additions, and also allows the use of the
h/j/k/l/y/u/b/n keys to "walk" (or, in combination with the shift or
control keys, to run or tunnel), which thus requires a variety of key
mappings to allow access to the underlying commands used for walking, 
running and tunneling. In particular, the "roguelike" keyset includes
many more "capital" and "control" keys, as shown below.

Note that any keys that are not required for access to the underlying
command set may be used by the user as "command macro" triggers (see
below). You may always specify any "underlying command" directly by
pressing backslash ("\") plus the "underlying command" key. This is
normally only used in "macro" definitions. You may often enter
"control-keys" as a caret ("^") plus the key (so "^" + "p" often
yields "^P").

Some commands allow an optional "repeat count", which allows you to
tell the game that you wish to do the command multiple times, unless
you press a key or are otherwise disturbed. To enter a "repeat count",
type '0', followed by the numerical count, followed by the command. You
must type "space" before entering certain commands. Skipping the
numerical count yields a count of 99. An option allows certain commands
(open, disarm, tunnel, etc) to auto-repeat.

Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction,
an inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the
symbol of a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of
time, a quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you
can hit return to choose the "default" response, or escape to cancel
the command entirely.

Some commands will prompt for a spell or an inventory item. Pressing
space (or '*') will give you a list of choices. Pressing "-" (minus)
selects the item on the floor. Pressing a lowercase letter selects the
given item. Pressing a capital letter selects the given item after
verification. Pressing a numeric digit '#' selects the first item (if
any) whose inscription contains "@#" or "@x#", where "x" is the current
"underlying command". You may only specify items which are "legal" for
the command. Whenever an item inscription contains "!*" or "!x" (with
"x" as above) you must verify its selection.

In Zangband, there are items which occasionally teleport you away,
asking for permission first. The recurring "Teleport (y/n)?" can be
annoying, and this behavior can be eliminated by inscribing the object
which causes the teleportation with "." (or any inscription containing
the character "."). With this inscription, the object will no longer
teleport you around nor keep asking you. If you want to restore the
teleport ability to the object, just remove the "." from its
inscription. Note that cursed items which teleport you are unaffected
by the inscription.

Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a "compass"
direction using any of the "direction keys" shown below. Sometimes,
you may specify that you wish to use the current "target", by pressing
"t" or "5", or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing "*"
(see "Target" below).

Each of the standard keysets provides some short-cuts over the
"underlying commands". For example, both keysets allow you to "walk" by
simply pressing an "original" direction key (or a "roguelike" direction
key if you are using the roguelike keyset), instead of using the "walk"
command plus a direction. The roguelike keyset allows you to "run" or
"tunnel" by simply holding the shift or control modifier key down while
pressing a "roguelike" direction key, instead of using the "run" or
"tunnel" command plus a direction. Both keysets allow the use of the
"5" key to "stand still", which is most convenient when using the
original keyset.

Note that on many systems, it is possible to define "macros" (or 
"command macros") to various keys, or key combinations, so that it is
often possible to make macros which, for example, allow the use of the
shift or control modifier keys, plus a numeric keypad key, to specify
the "run" or "tunnel" command, with the given direction, regardless of
any keymap definitions, by using the fact that you can always, for
example, use "\" + "." + "6", to specify "run east".

***** <SpecialKeys>
=== Special Keys ===
 
Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or
the host machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special
keys are control keys, and often, you can disable their special
effects.

If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will
interrupt Zangband. The second and third interrupt will induce a
warning bell, and the fourth will induce both a warning bell and a
special message, since the fifth will quit the game, after killing your
character. Also, Ctrl-Z will suspend the game, and return you to the
original command shell, until you resume the game with the "fg"
command. There is now a compilation option to force the game to prevent
the "double ctrl-z escape death trick". The Ctrl-\ and Ctrl-D and
Ctrl-S keys should not be intercepted.
 
It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually 
pressing the control key, by typing a caret ("^") followed by the key.
This is useful for specifying control-key commands which might be
caught by the operating system as explained above.

Pressing backslash ("\") before a command will bypass all keymaps,
and the next keypress will be interpreted as an "underlying command"
key, unless it is a caret ("^"), in which case the keypress after that
will be turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the
underlying Zangband keyset. The backslash key is useful for creating
macro actions which are not affected by any keymap definitions that may
be in force, for example, the sequence "\" + "." + "6" will always mean
"run east", even if the "." key has been mapped to a different
underlying command.

The "0" and "^" and "\" keys all have special meaning when entered
at the command prompt, and there is no "useful" way to specify any of
them as an "underlying command", which is okay, since they would have
no effect.

For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE will
abort the command. The "[y/n]" prompts may be answered with "y" or
"n", or escape. The "-more-" message prompts may be cleared (after
reading the displayed message) by pressing ESCAPE, SPACE, RETURN,
LINEFEED, or by any keypress, if the "quick_messages" option is turned
on.
 

***** <CommandCounts>
===  Command Counts ===
 
Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding
them with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count
expires, until you type any character, or until something significant
happens, such as being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work
to attack another creature. While the command is being repeated, the
number of times left to be repeated will flash by on the line at the
bottom of the screen.

To give a count to a command, type 0, the repeat count, and then the
command. If you want to give a movement command and you are using the
original command set (where the movement commands are digits), press
space after the count and you will be prompted for the command.
 
Counted commands are very useful for searching or tunneling, as they
automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may
also terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing
any character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a
SPACE or ESCAPE which are always ignored as commands in case you type
the command just after the count expires.

You can tell Zangband to automatically use a repeat count of 99 with
commands you normally want to repeat (open, disarm, tunnel, alter,
etc) by setting the "always_repeat" option.
 

***** <ObjectSelection>
===  Selection of Objects ===
 
Many commands will also prompt for a particular object to be used. For
example, the command to read a scroll will ask you which of the scrolls
that you are carrying that you wish to read. In such cases, the
selection is made by typing a letter of the alphabet. The prompt will
indicate the possible letters, and will also allow you to type the key
"*", which causes all of the available options to be described. The
list of choices will also be shown in the Choice window, if you are
using a windows environment and windows are turned on. Often you will
be able to press "/" to select an object from your equipment instead of
your inventory. Pressing space once will have the same effect as "*",
and the second time will cancel the command and run the "i" or "e"
command.
 
The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower case
letter. If lower case is used, the selection takes place immediately.
If upper case is used, then the particular option is described, and you
are given the option of confirming or retracting that choice. Upper
case selection is thus safer, but requires an extra key stroke.

For many commands, you can also use "-" to select an object on the
floor where you are standing. This lets you read scrolls or quaff
potions, for example, off the dungeon floor without picking them up.
Also see objects.txt#Inscriptions [1] for a details description of how
to us inscriptions to make object selection easier.
