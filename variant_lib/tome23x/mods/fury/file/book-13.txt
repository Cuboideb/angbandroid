                *** Bats (b) ***

Small flying creatures with webbed wings and sharp teeth.
The [[[[[ofruit bats] are the weakest of them all. Other kinds 
include [[[[[Utan], [[[[[ubrown], [[[[[wsnow], [[[[[sgrey], [[[[[Wsilver], [[[[[yyellow], [[[[[Ggreen],
[[[[[rred dragon], [[[[[bblue dragon], and [[[[[vdisenchanter bats]. The most
dangerous of this race the [[[[[BMongbats], [[[[[dVampire bats], [[[[[gBats] 
[[[[[gof Gorgoroth], and [[[[[RDoombats].

               *** Rodents (R) ***

Small chittering creatures with quick feet and sharp teeth.
The [[[[[Uwild rabbits] are utterly harmless unless angered, as 
are [[[[[oSquirrels]. The various giant mice ([[[[[wwhite], [[[[[Bsilver], [[[[[rred],
[[[[[bblue], and [[[[[yyellow]) and rats ([[[[[Wwhite], [[[[[sgrey], [[[[[Rpink], and [[[[[Gtree])
are somewhat dangerous, as they tend to run in large packs.
The [[[[[urock moles], [[[[[Dwererats], and [[[[[gsquirrels of Mirkwood] are
among the more dangerous rodents.


                *** Snakes (J) ***

Fast and stealthy creatures that slither along the floor. The
[[[[[Ueels] are harmless, except when angered. The large [[[[[bblue], [[[[[Wsilver],
[[[[[vpurple], [[[[[Rred], [[[[[sgrey], [[[[[yyellow], [[[[[ubrown], and [[[[[wwhite] snakes are 
somewhat dangerous. The [[[[[rRattlesnakes], [[[[[oCopperhead] snakes, 
[[[[[DBlack mambas], and [[[[[gKing cobras] are quite dangerous and fierce.
The aquatic [[[[[BElectric eels] and [[[[[GLimlugs] (sea serpents) are 
among the most dangerous of their kind.

               *** Beetles (K) ***

Very large insects with tough carapaces. Most of them are not
too dangerous. They come in the following varieties: [[[[[wwhite], 
[[[[[ubrown], [[[[[rred], [[[[[sgray], [[[[[oorange], [[[[[bblue], [[[[[Wsilver], [[[[[Ggreen], [[[[[Utree], 
[[[[[Rfire], [[[[[gstag], [[[[[Baquatic], [[[[[yslicer], [[[[[viridescent], and [[[[[Ddeath watch].


               *** Reptiles (R) ***

The majority of reptiles found on Middle-earth are not very 
dangerous - these include the [[[[[ynewts], [[[[[ucave lizards], [[[[[Urock lizards],
[[[[[bnight lizards], [[[[[Bblue lizards], [[[[[oswamp lizards], [[[[[rgiant pink frogs],
[[[[[ggiant green frogs], [[[[[wsnow-frogs], and [[[[[Wgiant silver frogs]. The 
[[[[[Rgiant salamanders] and [[[[[Ggiant turtles] should be approached 
with caution, while the [[[[[sbasilisks] and [[[[[Dgreater basilisks] are 
extremely dangerous and should not be toyed with!
