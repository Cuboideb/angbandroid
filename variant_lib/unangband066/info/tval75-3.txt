=== On Coating Sharp Weapons with Potions ===

The various harmful potions you find can be used 
by applying them to edged weapons using the apply command 
('y' or '^G' in the roguelike command set).  Not every 
weapon can be so coated: in particular most magical weapons 
will repell the potion's coating.  The potion coating also
makes the weapon slightly harder to use, so there is
a slight risk that you may cut yourself on the
envenomed edge and therefore have the potion coating
effects apply to you.

The coating, once applied, will have 20% of the effect-
iveness of the original potion with each successful
hit against the monster.  The coating will have
only so many charges before it becomes ineffective, so
you'll probably want to carry additional potions with
you to reapply the coating as and when required.

Potion coatings are 'blood agents' in that they are only
effective against monsters with circulatory systems.
You can tell these monsters as they bleed when cut.
Monsters without blood are not affected by potion
coatings.  In addition, the monster's usual resistances
will apply.  Often, the most effective coating users are
archers or throwing specialists who are able to fill
their quiver with a selection of coated weapons for use
against differing monsters.
