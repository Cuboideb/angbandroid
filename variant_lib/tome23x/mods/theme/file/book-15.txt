               *** Worms (w) ***

Large slimy masses of worms crawl all around dungeons.
There are [[[[[Bclear], [[[[[rred], [[[[[bblue], [[[[[ggreen], [[[[[wwhite], [[[[[yyellow],
[[[[[Dnether], and [[[[[vdisenchanter] worm masses. Additionally, 
there are [[[[[Ugiant slugs] and [[[[[ugiant leeches] which are more
dangerous than the worm masses. The [[[[[vpurple worms] and 
[[[[[ysandworms] are even more dangerous, and then there are
the [[[[[uwereworms], huge wormlike shapes dripping acid.

             *** Dragon worms (w) ***

These will eventually grow into dragons, unless killed.
There are [[[[[Rred], [[[[[Bblue], [[[[[Ggreen], [[[[[Wwhite], [[[[[sblack], [[[[[ygold], 
[[[[[ubronze], and [[[[[vmulti-hued ones].

            *** Hatchling dragons (d) ***

The [[[[[opseudo-dragon] is a small relative of the dragon that 
inhabits dark caves. The hatchling dragons are newly-born,
still soft, with eyes unaccustomed to light and scales 
shimmering with a hint of colour: [[[[[rred], [[[[[bblue], [[[[[ggreen], 
[[[[[wwhite], [[[[[sblack], [[[[[Ubronze], [[[[[ygold], and [[[[[vmulti-hued]. There are
also the aquatic [[[[[WHatchling dragon turtles].


              *** Young dragons (d) ***

The young dragons sport still-tender scales, coloured more
brightly than those of the Hatchling dragons: [[[[[rred], [[[[[bblue],
[[[[[ggreen], [[[[[wwhite], [[[[[sblack], [[[[[Ubronze], [[[[[ygold], and [[[[[vmulti-hued].
The [[[[[Wyoung dragon turtles] live in or near water.

                 *** Drakes (d) ***

These dragons are already mature, and their scales are very
brightly covered, according to the elements each dragon
draws its power from. There are [[[[[rFire-drakes], [[[[[bBlue drakes],
[[[[[gGreen drakes], [[[[[wCold-drakes], [[[[[sBlack drakes], [[[[[UBronze drakes],
[[[[[yGolden drakes], [[[[[vMulti-hued drakes], [[[[[vBalance drakes], [[[[[vLaw] 
[[[[[vdrakes], [[[[[vChaos drakes], [[[[[uCrystal drakes], [[[[[oEthereal drakes],
[[[[[GShadow drakes], and [[[[[sMature dragon turtles].


              *** Ancient dragons (D) ***

These dragons are very old, cunning, and powerful. They are
considerably larger than the drakes, and they too draw their
colouring from their elements: [[[[[rred], [[[[[bblue], [[[[[ggreen], [[[[[wwhite], 
[[[[[sblack], [[[[[Ubronze], [[[[[ygold], and [[[[[vmulti-hued]. In addition, there 
are the [[[[[GDeath drakes], [[[[[UGreat crystal drakes], [[[[[oAncient ethereal] 
[[[[[odrakes], [[[[[BSky drakes], and [[[[[WAncient dragon turtles].

             *** Greater dragons (D) ***

The mightiest and most powerful of dragonkind, these beasts
are older than time itself. Their very names instill fear into
your very soul: the [[[[[rGreat Worm of Fire], the [[[[[bGreat Storm Worm],
the [[[[[gGreat Swamp Worm], the [[[[[wGreat Ice Worm], the [[[[[sGreat Bile Worm],
the [[[[[UGreat Worm of Perplexity], the [[[[[yGreat Worm of Thunder],
the [[[[[vGreat Worm of Many Colours], the [[[[[GFastitocalon], the [[[[[vGreat] 
[[[[[vWorm of Balance], the [[[[[RDracolisk], the [[[[[vGreat Worm of Chaos], the
[[[[[GDracolich], the [[[[[BGreat Worm of Law], and the [[[[[vGreat Wyrm of Power].
