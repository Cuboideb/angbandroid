=== The World ===

After you have created your character, you will begin your adventures in
Unangband. Symbols appearing on your screen will represent the world's walls,
floor, objects, features, and creatures lurking about. In order to direct
your character through his adventure, you will enter single character
commands (see "commands.txt").


=== Locations ===

You begin in Hobbiton but will have to travel to distant lands to complete
your quest. Hobbiton is a fairly quiet place but you will find that the
danger escalates quickly as you stray from it. There are a number of
locations you can visit, each with their own challenges and rewards. Some
locations consist of a small towns, while others have dungeons deep
underground, tall towers, or big battlefields to explore.


=== Town Levels ===

You will find various towns in your adventures of Middle Earth.  They consist 
of buildings (each with an entrance), some townspeople, and a wall which
surrounds the town.  The first time you are in town it will be daytime, but
note that the sun rises and falls (rather instantly) as time passes.


=== Townspeople ===

The towns contain many different kinds of people.  There are the street
urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to
come out of the woodwork when excited.  Blubbering idiots are a constant
annoyance, but not harmful.  Public drunks wander about the town singing,
and are of no threat to anyone.  Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a
likely victim to mug.  And finally, no town would be complete without a
swarm of half drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just for
the fun of it. (There are assumed to be other people in the town, but they 
are not represented on the screen as they do not interact with the player
in any way.)

Most of the townspeople should be avoided by the largest possible distance
when you wander from store to store.  Fights will break out, though, so be
prepared.  Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no
experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.


=== Town Buildings ===

Your character will begin his adventure with some basic supplies, and some
extra gold with which to purchase more supplies at the town stores.

You may enter any open store and haggle with the owner to buy or sell items
of the appropriate type. The default mode in this game is "auto-haggle": 
a price is agreed on by the player and the shopkeeper, dependent on the 
price of the item, the player's charisma, the shopkeeper's "greed" factor 
(the Black Market shopkeepers are always *VERY* greedy), and the races of 
the player and shopkeeper. The player may get a better result by choosing 
to haggle personally (using the options screen to change this): the price 
given when auto-haggling is 10% worse than the best possible price that 
can be achieved by manual haggling. However, there is no guarantee of 
getting to the "best possible" or "final offer" price at all, or even close
to it, and the store keepers can sometimes take a dim view of people who 
try to haggle too hard - and throw such people out. This does not happen 
in auto-haggle mode.

Once inside a store, you will see the name and race of the store owner, the
name of the store, the maximum amount of cash that the store owner will pay
for any one item, and the store inventory, listed along with the prices. If 
auto-haggle is on, the price listed is the price you pay: if you are haggling 
manually, the price listed is his starting offer, which you can haggle 
downwards.

You will also see an (incomplete) list of available commands.  Note that
many of the commands which work in the dungeon work in the stores as well,
but some do not, especially those which involve "using" objects.

Stores do not always have everything in stock.  As the game progresses,
they may get new items so check from time to time.  Also, if you sell them
an item, it may get sold to a customer while you are adventuring, so don't
always expect to be able to get back everything you have sold.  Note that
the inventory of a store will not change while you are in town, even if you
save the game and return.  You must spend time in the dungeon if you wish
the store owner to clear out his stock and acquire new items.  If you have
a lot of spare gold, you can purchase every item in a store, which will
induce the store owner to bring out new stock, and perhaps even retire.

Store owners will not buy known harmful or useless items.  If an object is
unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.  Once they have
bought it they will immediately identify the object.  If it is a good object,
they will add it to their inventory.  If it was a bad bargain, they simply
throw the item away.  In any case, you may receive some knowledge of the
item if another is encountered.

Here is a list of the "basic" kinds of stores, altough you may find others
during your adventures:

The General Store ("1")
     The General Store sells foods, drinks, some clothing, torches, lamps,
     oil, shovels, picks, and spikes.  All of these items and some others
     can be sold back to the General store for money.

The Armoury ("2")
     The Armoury is where the town's armour is fashioned.  All sorts of
     protective gear may be bought and sold here, though the owner will not 
     stock anything better than bar chain mail unless it is sold to him
     by the player.

The Weaponsmith's Shop ("3")
     The Weaponsmith's Shop is where the town's weapons are fashioned.  Hand
     and missile weapons may be purchased and sold here, along with arrows,
     bolts, and shots. As with the armoury, not all weapon types will be 
     stocked here, unless they are sold to the shop by the player first.

The Temple ("4")
     The Temple deals in healing and restoration potions, as well as bless
     scrolls, word of recall scrolls, some approved priestly weapons, as
     well as prayer books.

The Alchemy shop ("5")
     The Alchemy Shop deals in all types of potions and scrolls.

The Magic User's Shop ("6")
     The Magic User's Shop deals in all sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and
     staves, as well as magic user books.

The Black Market ("7")
     The Black Market will sell and buy anything at extortionate prices.
     However it occasionally has VERY good items in it. The shopkeepers are
     not known for their tolerance...

Your Home ("8")
     This is your house where you can store objects that you 
     cannot carry on your travels, or will need at a later date.


=== Within The Dungeon ===

Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light, armor, and
weapons, he is ready to enter a dungeon.  However, first he has to travel
through wilderness (using the travel command "<") to find an entrance.
Look at the file "memap.txt" to get some idea of the layout of the regions 
of Middle Earth close to the starting town of Hobbiton. Once the entrance 
to a dungeon is chosen, move on top of the `>' symbol and use the "Down" 
command (">").

Your character will enter a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
arrive somewhere on the first level of the dungeon.  Each level of the
dungeon is fifty feet high (thus dungeon level "Lev 1" is often called
"50 ft"), and is divided into (large) rectangular regions (several times
larger than the screen) by titanium walls.  Once you leave a level by a
staircase, you will never again find your way back to that region of that
level, but there are an infinite number of other regions at that same "depth"
that you can explore later.  So be careful that you have found all the
treasure before you leave a level, or you may never find it again!  The
monsters, of course, can use the stairs, and you may eventually encounter
them again.

In the dungeon, there are many things to find, but your character must
survive many horrible and challenging encounters to find the treasure lying
about and take it safely back to the town to sell.

There are two sources for light once inside the dungeon.  Permanent light
which has been magically placed within rooms, and a light source carried by
the player.  If neither is present, the character will be unable to see.
This will affect searching, picking locks, disarming traps, reading scrolls,
casting spells, browsing books, etc.  So be very careful not to run out of
light!

A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply his own light.  A
torch or lamp burns fuel as it is used, and once it is out of fuel, it stops
supplying light.  You will be warned as the light approaches this point.
You may use the "Fuel" command ("F") to refuel your lantern (with flasks of
oil) or your torch (with other torches), so it is a good idea to carry extra
torches or flasks of oil, as appropriate.  There are rumours of objects of
exceptional power which glow with their own never-ending light.


=== Objects Found In The Dungeon ===

The mines are full of objects just waiting to be picked up and used.  How
did they get there?  Well, the main source for useful items are all the
foolish adventurers that proceeded into the dungeon before you.  They get
killed, and the helpful creatures scatter the various treasure throughout
the dungeon.  Many cursed items present in the dungeon - either left behind 
as the result of a failed attempt to create a magic items, or deliberately
placed by evil sorcerers who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed...

Only one object may occupy a given floor location, which may or may not also
contain one creature.  Doors, rubble, traps, and staircases are considered
"objects" for this purpose.  As below, any item may actually be a "pile" of
up to 99 identical items.  With the right choice of "options", you may be
able to "stack" several items in the same grid.

You pick up objects by moving on top of them.  You can carry up to 23
different items in your backpack while wearing and wielding up to 12 others.
Although you are limited to 23 different items, each item may actually be a
"pile" of up to 99 similar items.  If you "t"ake off an item, it will go 
into your backpack if there is room: if there is no room in your backpack,
it will drop onto the floor, so be careful when swapping one wielded weapon
or worn piece of armor for another when your pack is full.

You are, however, limited in the total amount of weight that you can carry.
As you approach this value, you become slower, making it easier for monsters
to chase you.  Note that there is no upper bound on how much you can carry,
if you do not mind being slow.  Your weight "limit" is determined by your
strength.

Many objects found within the dungeon have special commands for their use.
Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls must be Read, and potions
must be Quaffed.  You may, in general, not only use items in your pack, but
also items on the ground, if you are standing on top of them.

Chests are complex objects, containing traps, locks, and possibly treasure
or other objects inside them once they are opened.  Many of the commands
that apply to traps or doors also apply to chests.

One item in particular will be discussed here.  The scroll of "Word of
Recall" can be found within the dungeon, or bought at the temple in town.
It acts in two manners, depending upon  your current location.  If read
within the dungeon, it will teleport you back to the surface.  If read on the
surface, it will teleport you back down to the deepest level of the dungeon
which your character has previously been on.  This makes the scroll very
useful for getting back to the deeper levels.  Once the scroll has been read
it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't expect it to save you in a
crisis.  Reading a second scroll before the first has had a chance to take
effect will cancel both scrolls.

You may "inscribe" any object with a textual inscription of your choice.
These inscriptions are not limited in length, though you may not be able to
see the whole inscription on the item.  The game applies special meaning to
inscriptions containing any text of the form "@#" or "@x#" or "!x" or "!*",
see "commands.txt".

The game provides some "fake" inscriptions to help you keep track of your
possessions.  Wands and staves which are known to be empty will be inscribed
with "empty".  Objects which have been tried at least once but haven't been
identified yet will be inscribed with "tried".  Cursed objects are inscribed
with "cursed".  Broken objects may be inscribed with "broken".  Also, any
item which was purchased at a discount, implying that it is slightly
"sub-standard", will be inscribed with the appropriate "discount", such as
"25% off".  Note that these inscriptions are fake, and cannot be removed.

Also, occasionally you will notice that the objects you find seems to be 
magical.  When you do notice this, the item in question will be inscribed
with "good" or "cursed" as is relevant. Some classes, such as warriors,  
paladins (both well acquainted with weapons and armor) or rogues (who have
handled many powerful items in their time as stolen goods) are more
sensitive, and can notice not just that an item is out of the ordinary, but
just *how* extraordinary it is: they can notice an "excellent" item (ego
item), a "worthless" one (cursed ego item), a "special" one (artifact) and a
"terrible" one (cursed artifact). All classes will know an item is "special"
if it cannot be destroyed with the "k" command (original keyset.)

It is rumored that rings of power and extra rare spell books may be found
deeper in the dungeon...

And lastly, a final warning: not all objects are what they seem.  The line
between tasty food and a poisonous mushroom is a fine one, and sometimes a
chest full of treasure will grow teeth in its lid and bite your hand off...


=== Cursed Objects ===

Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid upon them.
These horrible objects will look like any other normal item, but will
detract from your character's stats or abilities if worn.  They will also
be impossible to remove until a remove curse spell is performed.  In fact 
some are so badly cursed that even this will not work, and more potent 
methods are needed.

If you wear or wield a cursed item, you will immediately feel deathly cold,
and the item will be marked with the fake inscription "cursed".

Shopkeepers will refuse to buy any item which is known to be cursed, either 
by having been identified or by being marked with the fake inscription.


=== Mining ===

Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by mining it out
of the walls.  Many rich strikes exist within each level, but must be found
and mined.  Quartz veins are the richest, yielding the most metals and gems,
but magma veins will have some hoards hidden within.

Mining is rather difficult without a pick or shovel.  Picks and shovels have
an additional magical ability expressed as `(+#)'.  The higher the number,
the better the magical digging ability of the tool.  A pick or shovel also
has plusses to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon, because, in fact,
it is one.

When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the character may wield his pick
or shovel and begin digging out a section.  When that section is removed, he
can locate another section of the vein and begin the process again.  Since
granite rock is much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the
vein exactly and dig around the granite.  Eventually, it becomes easier to
simply kill monsters and discover items in the dungeon to sell, than to walk
around digging for treasure.  But, early on, mineral veins can be a wonderful
source of easy treasure.

If the character has a scroll, staff, or spell of treasure location, he can
immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein shown on the
screen.  This makes mining much easier and more profitable.

Note that a character with high strength and/or a heavy weapon does not need
a shovel/pick to dig, but even the strongest character will benefit from a
pick if trying to dig through a granite wall.

It is sometimes possible to get a character trapped within the dungeon by
using various magical spells and items.  So it can be a good idea to always
carry some kind of digging tool, even when you are not planning on tunneling
for treasure.

There are rumors of certain incredibly profitable rooms buried deep in the
dungeon and completely surrounded by titanium and granite walls, requiring
a digging implement or magical means to enter.  The same rumors imply that
these rooms are guarded by incredibly powerful monsters, so beware!


=== Staircases, Secret Doors, Passages, and Rooms ===

Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper or climb out of the
dungeon.  The symbols for the up and down staircases are the same as the
commands to use them.  A "<" represents an up staircase and a ">" represents
a down staircase.  You must move your character over the staircase before
you can use it.

Each level has at least one up staircase and at least two down staircases.
There are no exceptions to this rule.  You may have trouble finding some well
hidden secret doors, or you may have to dig through obstructions to get to
them, but you can always find the stairs if you look hard enough.  Stairs,
like titanium walls, and shop entrances, cannot be destroyed by any means.

Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and demoralize
adventurers foolish enough to enter.  But with some luck, and lots of
concentration, you can find these secret doors.  Secret doors will sometimes
hide rooms or corridors, or even entire sections of that level of the
dungeon.  Sometimes they simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.
Secret doors always look like granite walls, just like traps always look
like normal floors.

Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use these secret doors, and
can often be counted on to leave them open behind them when they pass
through.

For historical reasons, secret doors are never locked.

=== Traps and Dangerous Terrain ===

Not all parts of the dungeon can be safely moved through. Hidden traps can
damage, confuse or ensorcle you. Deep pools of water, ice, acid, lava,
boiling water and other terrain can damage you directly or make it hard
to progress through parts of the dungeon.

You should search the dungeon regularly, or use trap detection magic to
try to locate traps as you explore the dungeon. Even when found, traps can
still pose a problem to disarm or avoid. The source of the trap is indicated
by a '^' symbol, and the region it affects by one or more 'x' symbols of the
same colour. It is possible to overcome a trap in one or two ways. Firstly,
you can disarm a trap by using the disarm command against the trap itself
('^'). Disarming a trap requires a level of skill - depending on your race
and class - and exposes you to the risk of accidentally triggering the trap
should you fail. It may also be difficult to reach the trap itself due to the
area it affects.

You can also avoid traps. Each trap has a method of avoiding it - some of
which can be difficult to discover. Some traps require time to recharge
after being triggered, so if you discover how to trigger the trap without
being affected, you can potentially bypass it. Others can be avoided by
moving slowly (searching) through the trap, blocking the missiles the trap
fires, or by wearing or using magical items which affect or mark you in
particular ways. Monsters can use the same methods to avoid traps, so
careful observation of which monsters are affected by which traps can help
you in this endeavour. You may even discover traps which don't appear to
affect you immediately - be cautious around these as they may be activated
by a change in condition in either yourself or the dungeon around you.

Damaging terrain can affect you in a number of different ways. You will
discover great lakes, moats and waterways during your time exploring the
dungeon: these can be filled with water, oil (burning or unlit), acid,
boiling mud or water or even lava. Shallow pools of water can usually
be safely navigated - deeper water will quickly tire you out and drown
you if you become exchausted, stunned or paralysed while in it, as well
as dousing torch or lamp lite. Most dangerous terrain will have relatively
safe passage through it: either spanned by a stone bridge or with a hidden
or covered path of comparatively safer footing. Temporary magics which
provide protection against the elements will also allow you to cross
terrain safely - as will boots which provide permanent protection against
the particular element. Various magics can be used to create bridges
across terrain: cold can be used to freeze a path over water (although
many swimming monsters will be capable of bashing up through the ice from
below) and even the humble potion of water can cool a thin crust
over lava.

Be cautious as well about clouds of smoke, poison or acidic vapour that
many magics can create when they burn wood or consume leather or metal.
These will drift around the dungeon burning and choking anyone long after
the initial magical effect has passed. And beware the risks of open flame
in the forests that growth both above ground and in the otherwise life-
less realms beneath.


=== Winning The Game ===

The goal of Unangband is to venture deep into the land of Mordor and kill 
Sauron, and into the depths of Angband to kill Morgoth.  Getting to Mordor is
not an easy journy however, and there are many who would wish to stop you
along the way.  Many locations you encounter will have guardians, which
prevent you from advancing further until you manage to kill them.  Note that
there are many routes to Mordor, some more obvious and some more difficult 
than others. Sauron and especially Morgoth are two of the most difficult
opponents in the game, so try to avoid wandering around on their levels
unless you are ready for battle. Morgoth has a habit of coming at you across
the dungeon, the Mighty Hammer 'Grond' in hand, to slay you for your
impudence.

Morgoth cannot be killed by some of the easier methods used on normal
creatures.  Morgoth, like all other "Unique" monsters, will simply teleport
away to another region of the level if you attempt to use a spell such as
destruction is upon him.  Morgoth, like some other monsters, cannot be
polymorphed, slept, charmed, or banished.  Magical spells like Mana Storm 
and Orb of Draining are effective against him, as are some of the more
powerful weapons, but he is difficult to kill and if allowed to escape for
a time he will heal himself rapidly.

If you should actually survive the attempt of killing Morgoth, you will
receive the status of WINNER.  You may continue to explore, and may even
save the game and play more later, but since you have defeated the toughest
creature alive, there is really not much point.  Unless you wish to listen
to the rumors of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the dungeon, or a suit 
of dragon scale mail that resists everything...

When you are ready to retire, simply "commit suicide" (using the "Q" key)
to have your character entered into the high score list as a winner.  Note
that until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire
before wandering into yet another horde of greater demons.


=== Upon Death and Dying ===
 
If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and cannot be
restored.  A tombstone showing information about your character will be
displayed.  You are also permitted to get a record of your character, and
all your equipment (identified) either on the screen or in a file.

Your character will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains only
the monster memory and your option choices.  It may be restored, in which
case a new character is generated exactly as if the file was not there, but
the new player will find his monster memory containing all the experience
of past incarnations.

There are a variety of ways to "cheat" death (including using a special
"cheating option") when it would otherwise occur.  This will fully heal
your character, returning him to the town, and marking him in various
ways as a character which has cheated death.  Cheating death, like using
any of the "cheating options", will prevent your character from appearing
on the high score list.
