=== A Brief Overview of Potions ===

It looks like you've found yourself a magical potion in your
travels recently.  These can be very useful items, and be sure 
to keep yourself in good supply of whatever potions you find
most useful.  The most common way of using potions is to quaff
them using the quaff command ('q').  This will allow the
potion to apply its effects immediately to yourself.

Most potions will have an beneficial effect when quaffed, some
may only have an effect if you are injured or otherwise
incapacitated, and some may have negative effects.
