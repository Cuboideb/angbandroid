=== On Food and Related Victuals ===

You'll need to be well-fed in order to be a succesful adventurer - if
you look at your inventory ('i') you'll see that you started with some
food, and perhaps 'one for the road'.  You can use the eat command
('E') to eat food and drink wine to satisfy your hunger.  Some foods
have additional properties that you can take advantage of, especially
the delicious mushrooms that are available at Farmer Maggot's mushroom
store.  Other mushrooms are not so tasty, even if you just have a
nibble, so be sure of what you eat first.  If it's poisonous, you'll
remember for later.

Keep an eye on your food levels.  If you don't eat properly, you'll
become weak with hunger, faint from lack of food and eventually
starve to death.  Many a noble adventurer has succumbed to the oversight
of not carrying enough food to allow them to journey safely through
wilderness.
