#####R=== Adanroeg (Man-demons) ===

#####GDescription
The greatest of all the lesser demons, these are humanoid
figures wreathed in living flame. Their most obvious
advantage is that they are completely immune to fire from
birth, because they are born in fire and all carry a small
part of the Flame of Udun inside them. They are equally 
good at magic and combat. With time, they learn to channel
the forces of darkness to temporarily assume Balrog form.
