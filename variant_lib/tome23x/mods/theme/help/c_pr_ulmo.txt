#####R=== Ulmo's Priests ===

#####GDescription
*****g_ulmo.txt*0[Ulmo] is the Lord of the Waters, second in power only
to Manwe, and the most wrathful of the Valar after Tulkas Astaldo. He
made a great contribution to the War of Wrath when he led Tuor to Gondolin,
and he is ever watchful for the contrivances of Melkor Bauglir. His 
preferred weapon type is the polearm, and his priests learn to become
very proficient with it. A priest of Ulmo is like unto living
water, channelled through Ulmo's magic.
