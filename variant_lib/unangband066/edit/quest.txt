# Quests are defined differently from most other info files. A quest consists of
# a number of stages (events). The stages currently defined are:

# Stage 0: The pre-conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to get the quest
# assigned.

# Stage 1: The quest requirements. This usually defines a location that will
# contain monsters, objects, and features required for the quest. This includes
# the way the quest alters the world while the player is assigned it. 

# Stage 2: This stage is used to track the player actions that contribute towards
# completion or failure of the quest. Do not define this stage in this file.

# Stage 3: The requirements in order to get the quest reward. This usually defines
# a location that the player must travel to in order to get their reward.

# Stage 4: The rewards for completing the quest. This can include permanent alteration
# of the world after successfully completing a quest to lose artifacts, 

# Stage 5: The conditions that will cause the quest to fail. This usually includes
# leaving the quest level before finishing the quest actions.

# Stage 6: The consequences of having a quest fail. This might include losing an
# artifact or causing a unique to never disappear.

# A counter for each quest keeps track of the stage the player is at. To succeed at a
# quest, the player must complete the actions defined in stage 1 and avoid any actions
# in stage 5. The quest stage will then move to stage 3; when they have fufilled these
# actions, the quest moves to stage 4 and stops.
