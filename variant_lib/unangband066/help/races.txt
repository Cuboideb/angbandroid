=== Races ===

There are many different races that you can choose from in Angband.  Some
races are restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race has
its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. Most races also
have intrinsic abilities.
 
***** <Man of Bree>
***** <Man of Dale>
***** <Man of Gondor>
***** <Man of Rohan>
         Man of Middle-Earth
               The men of Middle-Earth are the common stock of the land.
               All other races are compared to them.  Humans tend to
               go up levels faster than any other race because of their
               shorter life spans.  No other racial adjustments or
               intrinsics occur to characters choosing human, beyond a
               preference for certain skills or slight increase in stats
               depending on their place of origin.
 
***** <Wood-Elf>
         Wood-Elf
               The Wood-Elves of Middle-Earth hail from the woodland
               regions such as Mirkwood and Fangorn.  They are excellent
               archers, but poor fighters, and a beginning Wood-Elf should
               concentrate on using a sling, bow or crossbow to attack
               their opponents at range.  Wood-Elves cannot be have their
               agility or dexterity drained by injury, disease or magic
               and are resistent to light as are all elves.
               Wood-Elves have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
               creatures at a distance even if invisible or in the dark.
 
***** <Hobbit>
         Hobbits
               Hobbits, or Halflings as they are also known, are the small
               folk of the Shire, and have no allegiance to the major
               races of Middle-Earth although they are friendly with
               men, dwarves and elves.  Hobbits are poor at melee combat
               but are good archers and excellent at throwing weapons,
               so should stay at range and pummel their enemies with rocks,
               arrows or other ranged attacks.  They are also stealthy
               so unlikely to disturb monsters in the dungeon around them.
               Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
               creatures at a distance even if invisible or in the dark.
               Hobbits have have a strong hold on their life force, and  
               are thus intrinsically resistant to life draining by undead
               or powerful magics.
 
***** <Dwarf>
         Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
               Dwarves also have very good infra-vision because they live
               underground and they have a peerless affinity with the rock
               and earth around them.  They do have one big drawback, though.
               Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices,
               arguing with themselves for no good reason, screaming out
               challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a
               miserable stealth.  But whether through foresight or their
               innate magical resistance, dwarves can never be blinded. 

***** <Dunadan>
         Dunadan
               Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder
               race surpasses human abilities in every field, and hark back to
               the elder days, when great man strode through the world.
               However, being men of the world, very little is new to them,
               and levels are very hard to gain.  As a part of the heritage
               of Adan, a Dunadain's constitution cannot be reduced through
               illness, injury or magical attack.
 
***** <High-Elf>
         High-Elf
               High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard 
               and answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of 
               time, before the sun and moon were made, and lived in the 
               Blessed Realm for many thousands of years before returning to 
               mortal lands.  Because of this, they are far superior in terms 
               of abilities when compared to their lesser Elven kindred, and 
               are able to be priests as well as all the other classes that 
               normal Elves can be. They can also see into the invisible
               world of ghosts and wraiths.  However, they find new experience
               even harder to come by than Dunedain: and their wisdom is 
               still a little suspect. And like normal Elves, they resist
               attacks involving bright light.

***** <Maia>
         Maia
               The Maiar, lesser deities of the created world, often take
               tangible form and mingle among earthly beings.  They can be
               found among the ranks of wise counselors, peerless warriors,
               mighty wizards and deadly necromancers; indeed they can play
               any class with credit.  Their vital statistics put all other
               races to shame, their standard abilities are always good and
               sometimes superlative, and they recover divinely quickly from
               all sorts of wounds and ailments.  Maiar are perfect for those
               desiring a character able to survive the perils of an unfamiliar
               game.

In addition, you may unlock other playable races, as you progress through the
game.  You will be notified when this occurs, and a description, similar to
what you have been given above will be provided.  One such example is given
below.

***** <Shadow Fairy>
         Shadow Fairy
               Shadow Fairies are one of the many fey and magical races of
               Middle-Earth.  They are weak and easily hurt, having more
               of an affinity to magic than the physical world, and seem
               to shimmer and fade from this world, which makes them very
               hard to detect by monsters.  Shadow Faeries are vulnerable
               to the same cold iron weapons that are wrought to slay
               demons and so cannot use these weapons safely.  However,
               this very magical affinity allows them to regenerate mana
               much more quickly.
