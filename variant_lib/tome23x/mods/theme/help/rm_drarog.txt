#####R=== Draugroeg (Wolf Demons) ===

#####GDescription
Humanoids with long, snoutlike faces and shaggy fur around
the ears. They learn more quickly and have more magical 
powes than their Hurog cousins. They have a tendency to 
snarl, however, which makes them quite unstealthy. They too
learn to detect living and non-living beings around them as
they gain experience, but they can also learn to detect the
presence of powerful objects and beings before they even get
near them. Good with magic, they have the ability to harness
the power of their mind.
