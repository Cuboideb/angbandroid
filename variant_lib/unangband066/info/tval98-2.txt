=== A Quick Post-script ===

(Oops. You just read the other side of that crumpled note).

PS:

You can use a scroll or spell of Sense Magic to work out which
type of bag holds an item.  For instance, if you sense magic
on a scroll of Read Magic, you'll see that it belongs to a bag
of Scrying.

Similarly, a bag will swallow items that you may not have
identified yet.  This can clue you in to the nature of the
item.  You'll also notice that these items always end up in
the same pockets, something your ancestors may have recorded
for posterity.
