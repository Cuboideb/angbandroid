#####R== Technicians ===

#####GDescription
Technicians are strange rogues that do not know how to fight,
but have studied magic devices enough to be very powerful
at them. They can use these devices to do anything a powerful
sorcer can do, with the drawback of having to find suitable
equiptment. They can also learn some minor magic to recharge 
their wands and check to see how many charges they have left.
